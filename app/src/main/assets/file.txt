On the day prior\nto transfer, she ws out in public and experienced a sudden onset\nof worsened dyspnea.  She asked bystanders to call EMS and by\nthe time they arrived she was found unresponsive; did have a\npulse but was cyanotic and was intubed in the field.\n.\nAt the OSH, initial CXR showed congestive heart failure.  She\nwas given IV lasix and placed on a nitro drip.  After several\nhundred ml of urine was produced she became hypotensive,\nrequiring volume resuscitation and phenylephrine.  For a\npossible pneumonia she received ceftriaxone and azithromycin.\nShe was transfused one unit of pRBC for a hct of 29.  An echo\ndone at the OSH showed apical hypokinesis with a fairly\npreserved LVEF.\n.\nIn speaking with the son, he reports that over the past six\nmonths the patient's asthma has been under excellent control.\nShe was not requiring her albuterol rescue on most days.  It was\nfelt that this correlated, at least in part, to leaving a home\nenvironment which had previously been infested with mold.  Over\nthe last week or so, boxes from her prior home had been brought\nto her new home; it was the patient's feeling that these boxes\nhad contained mold and were the precipitant for her current\nexacerbation.\n\n\nPast Medical History:\n1.

Respiratory failure:\nPulmonary Dysfunction/Reactive Airway Disease: The most likely\netiology of the precipitating event in this patient is a severe\nexaccerbation of her known reactive airway disease. Regarding\nprecipitant, the re-introduction of mold is certainly intriguing\nand could also explain the CXR findings if it is felt that they\nrepresent an inflammatory response to some inhalation.  Other\nmore typical precipitants include a viral infection, pneumonia,\nPE (see below) and others.  The patient is was intubated and\nvented, requiring high levels of sedation to tolerate the\nventilator. Initially with respiratory acidosis with poor O2 due\nto vent disynchrony, but this improved with increased sedation.\nPatient pulmonary exam has improved remarkably, but the\ncontinued underlying pulmonary dysfunction could have been due\nto demonstrated poor chest wall compliance (seen on inspiratory\nhold), and current cardiac disease. Despite aggressive\nbronchodilator therapy, steroids, and antibiotic therapy, she\ncontinued to be difficult to adequately vent without substantial\nsedation and paralysis. Patient per report was tolerating the\nventilator at the outside hospital.  It was unclear what was\ncausing her dysynchrony when the sedation was lightened. After\nepisode [**10-22**] patient required paralysis.  [**10-23**] patient\nesophageal balloon revealed poor chest wall compliance and a\nneed for PEEP of 18 to normalize transplural pressures. Patient\ntolerated PEEP to 18 with stable blood pressures until stopped\nparalytics and lightened sedation.  Patient with prolonged\nexpiratory phase and stomach/CHF grunt during this time period\nand CE positive (paO2 changed from 119-99), patient placed back\non paralytics. While paralyzed [**Last Name **] problem with lung resistence.\nAttempts were made to wean sedation by using methadone and to\nwean her PEEP, but she continued to need paralysis.  A decision\nwas made to attempt a PA catheter for better understanding of\nher hemodynamic situation before attempting to extubate her.\nDuring this procedure, she suffered asystole with no antecedent\narrhythmia noted.  She was able to be resuscitated, but required\nventricular pacing.  Her family then decided to withdraw care\nand ventilator support.  She subsequently expired from cardiac\nfailure.\n.\n2. NSTEMI / CAD: Patient has had three coronary events.\nAt OSH in setting of hypotension, troponin to 0.6, felt to be\ndemand ischemia. Here enzymes trended downward, and heparin was\nstopped [**10-20**].  Per the son, the patient has not had any chest\npain.\nHere [**10-21**] O/N patient became hypotensive, tachycardia.\nTachycardia persisted for several hours, but did slowly trend\ndown in response to fluids. Ruled in for NSTEMI (CK 2895, MB 64,\nTroponin 1.26). On [**10-23**] O/N patient weaned off sedation, became\nagitated with prolonged expiration and grunt, CE from the time\non the event show active ischemia with increased enzymes, ECG\nsinus LBBB with diffuse t-wave inversions demonstrating\nconcordance in inferior and lateral leads - worsened compared to\n[**10-22**]. Transfused one unit pRBCs for ischemia with HCT \u003c30. She\nwas continued on a heparin drip, aspirin, plavix, and\nmetoprolol. Cardiology was following during her stay.\n.\n3: Congestive Heart Failure: Patient has had multiple espisodes\nof desaturations some of which are caused by attempts to wean\nsedation; however, some may be caused by pulmonary edema. [**10-21**],\npatient oxygenation and CXR responded very well to diuresis.\nPatient had cardiac event after night of fighting the vent and\nhypotension(toponin [**10-23**] 1.26). Demonstrated during this that\npatient showed flash pulmonary edema c/w intermittent ischemia\ncausing CHF.  She was continued on isosorbide dinitrate 10mg TID\nand diuresed as tolerated.\n.\n4. Leukocytosis: White blood cell count increasing, patient\nafebrile (but on steroids), no clear source.\nIn the setting of respiratory failure, leukocytosis suspicious\nfor PNA. Must also consider stress response with recent\nNSTEMI/Demand, episode where patient was found down vs\nalternative sources for infection. [**Month (only) 116**] also be due to increased\nsteroids for patient pulmonary presentation. Legionella OSH\nnegative. She was treated empirically for pneumonia.\n.\n5. Hyperglycemia / Diabetes:\nWas quite hyperglycemic at the OSH.  She was covered with at\n[**Hospital1 18**] insulin gtt. Patient amylase and lipase were within normal\nlimits. Attributed high insulin requirements to steroids for\npatient pulmonary disease.\n.\n6. Acute renal failure: At baseline.\nMost likely flow related given recent hypotension. Admitted with\nrenal failure, with urine lytes with FeUREA 15.6% suggesting\npre-renal etiology. Initial improvement with fluids. Feel\npatient at baseline (1-1.5).\n.\n7. Metabolic Acidosis: Resolved\nPatient low bicarb and was volume resusitated with significant\namount of lactate and had a coronary event. When accounting for\nbicarb it can be explained by patient's lactic acidosis. Gave\nback bicarbonate as one liter D5 with 3 amps of bicarb [**10-22**] am.\nPatient initially had a hyperchloremia which resolved with 2amps\nbicarbonate [**9-21**].\n.\n8. Hypotension: Given cardiac events feel hypotension may not be\ndiuresis, but instead cardiac ischemia causing acute CHF with\nhypotension. Hypertension upon arrival to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. Hypotension with\nintubation. Hypotension [**10-21**] O/N. Hypotensive [**10-23**] O/N in\nsetting of 2 L urine output on lasix and cardiac event. Improved\nwith decreased in PEEP from 18-14.\n.\n9. Tachycardia:\nReoccurred in the setting of hypotension and NSTEMI.\nOn admission felt tachycardia likely represents response to\npain, agitation given that she presents off sedation.  [**Month (only) 116**] be\ncomponent of volume depletion as well. With improved sedation\nand IVF boluses the patient was no longer tachycardic [**9-21**]. Only\nconcern in the setting of tachycardia and respiratory distress\nin relatively sedentary patient is PE. Although at this point\nlow suspicion given physical exam, and negative LENIs.

KUB obtained in the\nemergency dept was highly suspicious for sigmoid volvulus.  GI\nconsult was obtained by ED and sigmoid was detorsed via\ndecompression by flexible sigmoidoscopy.  Patient was then\nadmitted to the SICU for observation as he had desaturated to\nthe 80s while in the ED.  Patient did well overnight in the SICU\nand was deemed fit for transfer to the floor on hospital day#2.\nFollowing detorsion, the surgical team had a frank discussion\nwith the patient indicating the high likelihood of recurrence\nfor him given the megacolon demonstrated on KUB.  Understanding\nthis the patient was taken to the operating room on hospital day\n3 ([**7-30**]) for sigmoid colectomy. Patient tolerated the procedure\nwell and was admitted to the floor (CC6).\n\nNeuro: Prior to surgery on [**7-30**] an epidural was placed with good\neffect.  Epidural was removed on [**8-1**].  Following this, the\npatient received Morphine IV with good effect and adequate pain\ncontrol. When tolerating oral intake, the patient was\ntransitioned to oral pain medications.  Following second\nprocedure [**8-4**] patient was discharged the SICU intubated/sedated.\n As sedation was lightened, he was given intermittent dilaudid\nIV and tylenol IV with adequate pain control.  Analgesia\ntransitioned to po when tolerating oral intake.\n\nExtrapyramidal symptoms secondary to psychiatric medications\nwere treated with zyprexa with good effect.\n\nCV: On admission to SICU [**7-28**] patient required prn doses of\nlopressor/hydralazine for BP control.  These were continued on\nthe floor postoperatively.  Lasix was initially held then\nresumed when patient had achieved adequate fluid balance.\nFollowing second surgery [**8-4**], the patient transiently required\npressors to maintain adequate BP.  Pressors were weaned [**8-5**] and\npatient was transferred back to CC6.  Vital signs were routinely\nmonitored.\n\nRUE swelling noted [**8-10**] prompted U/S RUE [**8-11**] that showed\nbasilic v thrombosis extending to axillary vein.

The patient was stable from\na pulmonary standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.\n\nGI/GU: Patient presented as above and was made NPO/IVF/NGT\nfollowing surgery [**7-30**].  NGT was self-d/c'd on POD0-1.  Patient\ntolerated sips on POD1.  Patient was slow to resume bowel\nfunction and was maintained on sips.  On POD5 patient complained\nof significant abdominal distention/pain.  CT scan showed\ncopious intra-abdominal free air and patient was taken back to\noperating room for exploratory laparotomy [**8-4**].  Small pinhole\nleak at anastomosis was taken down and Hartmann's procedure was\nperformed.  Postoperatively, patient had ileus and colostomy was\ncannulated with a red rubber catheter to aid in decompression.\nKUB's obtained were consistent with ileus.  Given failure to\nresume bowel function, TPN was started [**8-8**].  Bowel function\nthen returned and patient then tolerated clears [**8-9**].  Diet was\nadvanced to regular [**8-10**] and TPN was discontinued at this time.\nHe was also started on a bowel regimen to encourage bowel\nmovement.\n\nFoley was removed on POD#3 with removal of epidural and patient\nfailed trial of void.  Foley was replaced and patient discharged\nwith foley in place to attempt trial of void conducted by PCP vs\nrehabilitation facility.  Intake and output were closely\nmonitored.\n\nID: Patient was initially given appropriate surgical prophylaxis\nfor procedure [**7-30**].

Please see catheterization report for full\ndetails.  Summary of his catheterization showed 2+ mitral\nregurgitation with an ejection fraction of 45%, left main 70%\nlesion, left anterior descending artery, no significant\ndisease, left circumflex 80% at the origin, ostia 99%\nproximal, 100% in the distal.\n\nCT Surgery was consulted.  The patient was seen and accepted\nfor coronary artery bypass grafting plus or minus mitral\nvalve repair/replacement.  On [**2-11**], the patient was\nbrought to the operating room at which time, he underwent\ncoronary artery bypass grafting x4 with a mitral valve\nrepair.  Please see OR report for full details.\n\nIn summary, the patient had a coronary artery bypass graft x4\nwith a LIMA to the left anterior descending artery, saphenous\nvein graft to OM and ramus sequentially, and saphenous vein\ngraft to the distal right coronary artery, and a mitral valve\nrepair with a #28 [**Doctor Last Name 405**] ring.  The patient tolerated the\noperation well and was transferred from the operating room to\nthe Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.\n\nAt the time of transfer, the patient was receiving milrinone\nat 0.25 mcg/kg/minute, Neo-Synephrine at 1.5 mcg/kg/minute,\nand propofol at 10 mcg/kg/minute.  The patient was extubated\nshortly after arrival in the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care\nUnit, he developed stridor after extubation, and was\nimmediately reintubated.  He showed a respiratory acidosis.\n\nTransesophageal echocardiogram was done at that time, which\nshowed the patient to be underfilled.  He was given volume\nand he responded well.\n\nOn postoperative day one, the patient remained\nhemodynamically stable.  An attempt to decrease the sedation\nand wean his ventilation was unsuccessful.  The patient was\nresedated and remained on full ventilatory support.\n\nOn postoperative day two, the patient remained\nhemodynamically stable on Esmolol, Levophed and milrinone.\nHe also remained stable from a respiratory standpoint.  His\nmilrinone was weaned off.  He did have a period of atrial\nfibrillation, and was started on amiodarone at that time.\n\nOn postoperative day three, patient became somewhat hypoxic\nas sputum production increased and he was empirically started\non ceftriaxone, and sputum cultures were sent at that time.\n\nOver the next two days, the patient was weaned from his\ncardioactive intravenous medications.  Sputum culture is\nbeing positive for Pseudomonas and his antibiotics were\nchanged from ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime.\n\nOn postoperative day six, the patient was weaned from his\nventilator and successfully extubated.  He remained in the\nIntensive Care Unit at that time.  Because of continuous\nrespiratory status with vigorous chest PT as well as\nantibiotics, the patient's respiratory status continued to\nimprove over the next several days.\n\nOn postoperative day nine, it was decided that he was stable\nand ready to be transferred to Far Two for continued\npostoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation.  Over the next\nseveral days on the floor, the patient with the assistance of\nthe nursing staff and physical therapy, he increased his\nactivity level.  He remained hemodynamically stable\nthroughout that period.\n\nOn postoperative day 15, it was decided that the patient was\nstable and ready to be transferred to a rehabilitation\nfacility.

Prior to heparin gtt,\nrectal exam revealed brown guiac positive stool. Given\nhypotension and recent surgery the ED was also concerned for\nsepsis so the patient was given cefepime, vanc and levoflox. A\nfoley was placed with cloudy urine and u/a had \u003e50 WBCs. Blood\nand urine cultures were drawn. Exam was also notable for\npurulent drainage and staples from his surgery on [**5-19**] so [**Month/Day (4) **]\nspine was called.

There is extensive occlusive thrombus in the left\nsuperficial\nfemoral vein extending to the popliteal vein. Right-sided veins\nare patent\nwith normal compressibility, flow, and augmentation. Calf veins\nwere not\nvisualized due to patient's body habitus.\nIMPRESSION: DVT throughout the entire left superficial femoral\nvein extending through the popliteal vein.\n.\nCT CHEST:\nCT OF THE CHEST WITH CONTRAST: There are extensive bilateral\npulmonary emboli extending from the bilateral distal main\npulmonary arteries into the lobar, segmental and subsegmental\nbranches. There is an area of hypoenhancing wedge-shaped opacity\nat the left lung base which is most consistent with pulmonary\ninfarct. Small amount of atelectasis is also noted at the left\nlung base.\n\nThere is mild bowing of the interventricular septum, concerning\nfor right\nheart strain. The main pulmonary artery is also mildly enlarged.\nThere is\nalso a trace pericardial effusion.\n\nThere is no mediastinal, hilar or axillary lymphadenopathy. The\nairways are patent.\n\nCT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: Please note that there is\nsignificant\nartifact from the patient's overlying arms limiting evaluation.\nThe spleen, adrenal glands, pancreas, stomach, and\nintra-abdominal loops of bowel are within normal limits.\nMultiple tiny hypodensities are noted in the kidneys\nbilaterally, too small to characterize. A small cyst is noted\nwithin the interpolar region of the left kidney.\n\nGallbladder is distended but otherwise normal in appearance.\nThere is no\nretroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. No free air or\nfree fluid is present.\n\nCT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: There is a large amount of\nstool within\nthe rectum. A Foley catheter is noted within a decompressed\nbladder. Small\namount of air within the bladder is likely due to recent\ninstrumentation.\nThere is no free fluid. No pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy is\npresent.\n\nBONE WINDOWS: No concerning osseous lesions are identified.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Extensive bilateral pulmonary emboli, spanning from the\ndistal main\npulmonary arteries into the lobar, segmental and subsegmental\nbranches. Area of pulmonary infarct in the left lower lobe.\nMildly enlarged main pulmonary artery suggests component of\npulmonary hypertension. In addition, bowing of the\ninterventricular septum raises concern for right heart strain.\nRecommend echocardiogram for further evaluation of cardiac\nfunction.\n2.

Subcutaneous air noted in the right arm, incompletely\nassessed.\n.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n63 YO F with Parkinson's and progressive dementia s/p recent\nhospitalization for fall with 2 c-spine operations now\npresenting with altered mental status, hypoxia and hypotension\nfound to have submassive pulmonary emboli on imaging.\n.\n# Pulmonary embolism: She was found to have extensive bilateral\npulmonary emboli on chest CT with evidence of right heart strain\nand slightly elevated troponin. She was started on a heparin\ndrip for systemic anticoagulation. She remained hemodynamically\nstable in the ICU and was transferred to the floor. On [**6-8**], pt\nwas started on Warfarin, and her INR was trended.\n.\n# LLE DVT: LENI's done on [**2135-6-7**] demonstrated DVT throughout\nthe entire left superficial femoral vein extending through the\npopliteal vein. There was concern that due to her high clot\nburden in her lungs, pt would not tolerate another PE. Heme/onc\nwas consulted. Through review of the literature it appeared that\nIVC filters had their greatest benefit in the first few days of\nDVT (up to 12 days). However, given concern that there would be\ndifficulty in retrieving the filter, we opted to first repeat\nLENI's to assess for clot progression since it was found on\n[**2135-6-6**]. It showed extension into the femoral artery, and the\nstudy was unable to visualize extension into the pelvis. Given\nconcern for clot progression, and IVC filter was placed on\n[**2135-6-10**] by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] indicated the filter\ncould be retrieved in approx 4 weeks time.

She had been\nseen earlier that morning around 0630 and had been sleeping, but\nawakened to voice and was trying to speak. Pt found to have O2\nsats 96% on RA; an ABG was done which showed mild respiratory\nalkolosis but PO2 was normal. Pt had stat head CT without which\nshowed no acute intracranial abnormality. Neuro was consulted,\nwho suggested that some of her mental status changes could be\nattributed to her severe [**Last Name (un) 309**] Body dementia. However, seizure\nwas also on the DDx.  An EEG was ordered, but there was an\nequipment failure and it was never performed.  In discussing the\ncase with Neurology, they felt seizure was very low on the DDx\nso it was not pursued further.\n.\n# ?Urinary tract infection/Urinary Retention: Pt was found to\nhave a grossly positive UA on admission. She was started\nempirically on Levofloxacin as well as broad spectrum\nantibiotics (cefepime and vancomycin) transiently.  UCx came\nback as contaminated. Her levofloxacin was stopped on [**2135-6-11**].\nOn [**6-14**], a repeat U/A (straight cath sample) was sent that\nshowed moderate bacteria, no WBC.  Urine culture is pending at\nthe time of discharge.  She clinically appears well with no\nleukocytosis.  Her only urinary complaint is new urinary\nretention.  She had had incontinence with frequent bed wetting\n(? overflow incontinence) till Saturday, [**6-11**].  Then, on [**6-12**],\nshe was noted to have diminished/absent urinary output.  She was\nfound to have significant urinary retention since and has\nrequired intermittent straight catheterization.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]\ndiscussed this with Neurology who felt that it was unlikely due\nto her Neurologic or Psychiatric medications as she has been on\nthese medications for some time.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] discussed the\nsituation with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1007**] who felt that the urinary\nretention may be related to her initial cervical spine injury\nbut that there was not much to be done at this time about it.\n.\n# C-spine surgery, Surgical site: Orthopedics spine was\nconsulted and felt that the surgical wound was healing\nappropriately without evidence of surgical site infection.

Continued digoxin which was\nstarted on the floor.  HR did not increase above 120s and\npatient was not started on a Diliazem ggt.  Patient was\nsuccessfully cardioverted on [**8-19**] in normal sinus rhythm.  Per\ncardiology recs, he was started on Metoprolol 25mg PO q8h and\ndigoxin was continued.  Patient remained in normal sinus rhythm\nand was transferred to the floor.\n\nImaging notable for potential lung and liver involvement of\nprimary tumor.  Primary oncologist notified and will f/u as\noutpt. Will likely change trajectory of care plan.\n\n===\nACTIVE ISSUES\n====\nHypotension: Likely multifactorial with dehydration from\nvomiting and poor PO intake contributing, as well as his new\na-fib with RVR causing decreased atrial kick. Infection given\nhis abnormal substrate (esophageal cancer) was of concern. He\nwas resuscitated with 5L NS prior to coming to the ICU and was\nstarted on neosynephrine. He was treated with vancomycin and\ncipro for potential infectious causes while awaiting culture\ndata. He did have a red, warm elbow that he thought was\nconsistent with an RA flare, though it warrants monitoring. He\nwas afebrile without a leukocytosis. His pressors were weaned\noff and his blood pressure was stable in the 90s-100s prior to\ntransfer to the floor.   Hypotension resolved with\ncardioversion.\n\nA-fib with RVR: New a-fib. He has had a history of PAF in the\nsetting of pericarditis related to his RA in his 20s. He was\nvolume resuscitated in the ED with 5L. He remained in a-fib,\nthough his rate was controlled in the 100s. He was dig loaded,\nand a potential infectious precipitant was treated as above. A\nCT was done given his recent PE, and it showed a decreased clot\nburden. Echo was normal with a non-dilated LA. Cardiac enzymes\nwere negative, and a TSH was elevated (free T4 nl). Pt was\ncardioverted with sedation in the MICU, and returned to NSR.\nContinued lovenox and metoprolol 25mg tid.  Transitioned to\noutpt toprol xl                75mg qd.

The catheterization revealed three vessel\ncoronary artery disease with normal left ventricular function.\nHe was then referred to cardiac surgery and brought to the\noperating room for emergent coronary bypass grafting. See\noperative report for details in summary he had:\n1. Urgent coronary artery bypass graft x 5 with left internal\nmammary artery to left anterior descending artery and saphenous\nvein grafts to diagonal 1 and diagonal 2, and posterior\ndescending arteries and a left radial artery to ramus.\n2. Endoscopic harvesting of the long saphenous vein.\n3. Left radial artery harvesting.\nHis bypass time was 113 minutes with a crossclamp time of 88\nminutes. He tolerated the operation well and post operatively\nwas transferred from the operating room to the cardiac surgery\nICU. He remained hemodynamically stable in the immediate post-op\nperiod, woke neurologically [**Hospital1 5235**] and was extubated. He\nremained hemodynamically stable throughout the remainder of the\noperative day and on POD1 was transferred to the stepdown floor\nfor continued post-op recovery and care. At the time of transfer\nthe patients chest tubes remained in place because of an air\nleak. Over the next 24 hours the patient had his chest tubes\nremoved sequentially as the airleak had resolved. A post pull\nchest film showed no apparent pneumothorax. A repeat film was\nobtained on POD3 because the patient was complaining of\ndifficulty taking a deep breath, this Xray revealed a\nsubstantial right pneumothorax and a lateral chest tube was\nplaced with complete expansion of lung. The remainder of his\nhospital course was uneventful, his chest tube was removed on\nPOD4. He worked with nursing and physical therapy to increase\nhis strength and conditioning nad on POD6 he was discharged home\nwith visiting nurses. He is to follow up with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 7772**] in\n1 month. Given his radial artery graft, he should remain on\nImdur to prevent vasospasm.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nAMLODIPINE 15 mg Daily\nATENOLOL 100 mg Daily\nHYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE 25 mg Daily\nLISINOPRIL 80 mg Daily\nLOSARTAN 50 mg Daily\nSPIRONOLACTONE 25 mg Daily\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1. docusate sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2\ntimes a day).\nDisp:*60 Capsule(s)* Refills:*0*\n2. ranitidine HCl 150 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2\ntimes a day).\nDisp:*60 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*\n3. aspirin 81 mg Tablet, Delayed Release (E.C.)

The patient reports a hard time\nsleeping on the night prior to admission and then at 5:00\na.m. developed dyspnea without chest pain, nausea, vomiting\nor diaphoresis or other symptoms.  She denies fevers or\nchills, night sweats, dietary indiscretions, and\nnoncompliance that would explain failure.  She is typically\ndialyzed Monday, Wednesday and Friday.  Her blood pressure in\nthe Emergency Department was 210/100 and given intravenous\nHydralazine before being seen by the medicine team.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\n1.

Insulin NPH and sliding scale.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives in [**Location 686**] originally\nfrom [**Location (un) 4708**].  She denies tobacco and alcohol use.  She has\nsix children.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Notable for diabetes.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination the patient's\ntemperature was 99.5, pulse 85, blood pressure 198/72.\nRespiratory rate 15.  98% on 4 liters.  General, this is a\nsomnolent woman in no acute distress.  Neck examination she\nhad JVD to the angle of the jaw.  Lungs had decreased breath\nsounds bilaterally.  There is bibasilar crackles.  She was\ndull to percussion at the bases.  Heart examination regular\nrate and rhythm with occasional premature beats.  No murmurs,\nrubs or gallops.  Abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended.\nPositive bowel sounds.  Extremities no clubbing, cyanosis or\nedema.\n\nLABORATORY:  White blood cell count was 18.9 with 89% polys,\nhematocrit 29.1, platelets 265.  Her chem 7 she had a sodium\nof 138, potassium 4.3, chloride 90, bicarb 32, BUN 42,\ncreatinine 7.2, glucose 211.  She had a CK of 99, troponin of\n.09.  Chest film she had bilateral pulmonary infiltrates,\ncardiomegaly consistent with congestive heart failure.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Later on the day of admission while\nbeing previously stable she developed significant hypoxia\nconsistent with flash pulmonary edema.  Her blood pressure\nescalated to approximately 260/110 with crackles throughout\nher lung examination.  She developed pink frothy sputum and\nsating at the mid 80s on 6 liters ultimately requiring a face\nmask and sating better.  At this time there are several\ntherapies undergone.  She was given 80 mg of Lasix with poor\ndiuretic response.  Because the patient makes very little\nurine as well as started on a nitroglycerin drip to lower\nblood pressure.  She was also given a total of 8 mg of\nmorphine with significant improvement.  After these symptoms\nbegan the Intensive Care Unit team was called and the\ndecision was made to put the patient on BiPAP and transferred\nto the Intensive Care Unit.\n\nDuring this time she was still hypertensive and the patient\nwas given intravenous Metoprolol.  ............ Service who\nhad earlier consulted on the patient was consulted again and\nthey deferred emergent dialysis pending more medical\nmanagement.  After increase in the nitroglycerin drip the\npatient's blood pressure finally responded going under 180 to\n190 with significant improvement in her symptoms and oxygen\nsaturation at this point.  She was transferred to the\nIntensive Care Unit and given BiPAP overnight.  Over the next\nseveral days the patient underwent several rounds of\nhemodialysis with ultra filtration prior to that to take off\nmore volume.  The plan was to over the next week and in\ncoming times to take off more fluid with dialysis likely\nhaving an ultra filtration prior to actually initiating\nhemodialysis.\n\nBy discharge the patient was in much better respiratory shape\nwith sating in the mid to high 90s on room air without any\ndyspnea.\n\n2.  Hypertension:  The patient presented with hypertensive\nemergency.  She was started on Metoprolol q.d. instead of\nthree times a week and was discharged with Toprol XL 50 due\nto heart failure.  Further cardiac workup was postponed for\nseveral reasons.  For one she had a cardiac consult in [**Month (only) 116**],\nwhich suggested that her previous MIBI scan was interpretable\nand further study would require an MRI, which we did not have\nat this institution.  In addition, the patient deferred\ncardiac catheterization and so further ischemic workup was\nnot indicated.  The Clonidine patch, which she had been on\nadmission was discontinued and was replaced with Metoprolol.\nThis was in [**Location (un) **] the Renal Service who would like more room\nwith her blood pressure to take off fluid during dialysis and\nultra filtration.\n\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.\n\nDISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.\n\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:\n1.

Stent was placed\nand patient was treated with antibiotics (Zosyn - \u003e\nCiprofloxacin).  Per ERCP fellow, plan is for patient to return\nin four weeks to see Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **], at which time he will\nlikely have repeat cholangiogram and removal of stent and stone.\nIf this is still [**Name (NI) 2480**], pt may also need a sphincterotomy.\n Dr.[**Name (NI) 2798**] secretary will contact patient at home the week\nafter discharge to schedule this for the end of [**Month (only) 404**].  Pt is\nto continue ciprofloxacin for a complete 14 day course.\n\n2)Mechanical mitral valve: Anticoagulation was reversed for\nERCP. After this he was anticoagulated with heparin drip. INR\nwas 1.9 on discharge. He was given sc lovenox x 1 and will\ncontinue this the day after discharge [**Hospital1 **] for one day. VNA will\ncheck his INR at home and page his PCP with the results.\n\n3)Atrial fibrillation: Rate controlled and on warfarin.  While\nin the hospital he had several episodes of pauses, none longer\nthan 2.5 seconds.  His digoxin was held and his metoprolol was\ntitrated down from his home dose.  Once the digoxin was no\nlonger having effect, metoprolol was titrated back to home dose.\n\n4)CHF: Pt was oxygen dependent for most of the hospital course,\nCXR was consistent with pulmonary edema.  He was diuresed with\nlasix with good effect.  Volume overload likely ocurred in the\nsetting of IV fluids given in the ICU.  Did not require lasix on\ndischarge.\n\n5)E. coli bacteremia/sepsis: Source of acute cholangitis as\nabove.   Pt required 3 day stay in the surgical ICU and\nintubation as above.\n\n6)Intubation: Pt was 97% on room air on arrival to ED, developed\nrapid ventricular reponse to a fib which was treated, but after\nthat period of time required oxygen, presumably for pulmonary\nedema.  In the [**Name (NI) **] pt was given 3L NS as well as 1 unit of FFP,\nand oxygen requirements contimued to climb.  In the SICU pt was\nintubated for ERCP procedure.

Per the patient's wife, over the last week he has\ndeveloped progressive abdominal distention and discomfort. The\npain is diffuse across his abdomen. He denies nausea or\nvomiting. He has also had progressive SOB over the same period\nof time. He has been using his nebulizer up to every 2 hours\nwith minimal relief. His wife reports that his appetite was\nintially ok, however over the last few days his PO intake has\ndecreased and he did not eat anything for dinner last night. He\ndenies fever, chills, or cough. He also denies dysuria. He has\nhad constipation fo rwhich he took Milk of Magnesia tablets last\nevening and today with his last BM this morning.\n.\nOf note the patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from\n[**Date range (1) 14195**] for dyspnea. He was admitted to the MICU for tachypnea\nto 50s and oxygen requirement. In the ICU, he required bipap\nwhich was gradually weaned off to his home 2.5L NC with sats in\nthe 89-91 range. Patient\nsymptomatically felt better. A chest X-ray showed RUL infiltrate\n\nconsistent with pneumonia. He continued solumedrol and Abx were\n\ntapered to levaquin alone. He developed new onset a fib and was\nstarted on diltiazem for rate control. He was discharged home on\nprednisone taper and completed 7 day course of levofloxacin.\n.\nIn the emergency department initial VS were BP 114/54 HR 108 RR\n36 O2 sat 99% 4L. CT abdomen was performed and showed new\nascites and worsening of his liver and omental mets. Surgery\nevaluated him for ? SBO. They did not see signs of obstruction,\nfelt that he had likely ileus from progressive metastatic\ndisease and is not a surgical candidate. NGT was placed for\ncomfort. Labs were notable for K 6.0 without EKG changes. He was\ngiven D50 and insulin. He also received solumedrol 125mg IV,\nvanco 1gm, zosyn 4.5gm, combivent nebs x2 and 2L NS.\n.\nCurrently the patient states his breathing feels much better. He\ncontinues to have some abdominal discomfort with exam. He denies\nchest pain, fever, cough, nausea or vomiting. He reports that\nthe NGT is uncomfortable when he swallows.\n\n\nPast Medical History:\n1) CAD s/p MI in [**2140**] by EKG diagnosis, no admission, no\nsymptoms, ETT/MIBI [**2159**] showing partially reversible defect in\nRCA distribution. No interventions performed.\n2) HTN\n3) Hyperlipidemia\n4) COPD\n5) DJD\n6) Thoracic artery aneursym, stable\n7) Nonsmall cell lung cancer (see below)\n\nONCOLOGIC HISTORY:\nMr. [**Known lastname 14194**] was in his USOH until [**2163-7-25**] when he\npresented with hemoptysis and weight loss of 10 pounds over\nprevious 1-2 months. He had a CT scan of the chest on [**8-21**] and\nit showed a 4.1 x 4.0 right hilar mass with subcarinal\nlymphadenopathy, 19 mm right axillary lymph node as well as\nmultiple right lower lobe and left lower lobe nodules concerning\nfor lung cancer. On [**2163-8-28**], he was admitted to [**Hospital1 771**] with chest pain and ruled out for a\nnon-ST elevation MI. He was seen by the hematology-oncology\nconsult service while in the hospital and underwent FNA of the\nright axillary lymph node, the pathology of which showed\nnonsmall cell cancer, squamous cell type. He was discharged on\nthe third of [**Month (only) 359**] and then on [**2163-8-30**], he had a\nbronchoscopy done for evaluation of his hemoptysis as well as\nbronchial biopsy and the cytology confirmed metastatic nonsmall\ncell lung cancer. He has subsequently completed 2 cycles of\nNavelbine.\n\nSocial History:\nHe lives in [**Location 3146**]. He is married and has a daughter and a son.\n[**Name (NI) **] has two grandchildren. He is here today with his wife \u0026 son.\n[**Name (NI) **] smoked for at least 50 years, stopped smoking 3-4 years ago.\nHe drinks occasional alcohol. He used to work as a carpenter, it\nis unclear if he has had asbestos exposure.\n\n\nFamily History:\nFather died at age 43 of unknown causes.\nMother died of breast cancer complications at age 53.\nSister had breast cancer and lung cancer and died at age 80\n\nPhysical Exam:\nVS: T 97.2, BP 122/70, HR 97, RR 24, O2sat 93% on 4LNC, Wt 140\nlbs,\nHeight 62\"\nGEN: Wearing NC, breathing with pursed lips on expiration.\nHEENT: NC/AT.\nNECK: Thin, suppple, no lymphadenopathy\nPULM: Diffusely decreased breath sounds and air movement. No\ncrackles or wheezes.\nCARD: RR, nl S1, Sl S2, II/VI systolic murmur RUSB\nABD: BS+, soft, NT, ND\nEXT: Clubbing of fingernails on hands bilaterally, no LE edema\nSKIN: No rashes\nNEURO: Oriented x 3, non-focal exam\nPSYCH: Patient upbeat with joking manner\n\n\nPertinent Results:\n[**2164-2-19**] CT abdomen\nWorsened metastatic disease with innumerable hepatic metastases,\n\nenlarging and new implants adjacent to the stomach and spleen in\nthe omentum\nand new ascites and omental deposits.\n\n[**2164-2-20**] CTA chest\n1. Progression of abdominal metastatic disease, partly\nvisualized and better\ncharacterized on a CT from the prior day.\n\n2. Right hilar mass with a similar degree of narrowing of\nsegmental pulmonary\narteries, but exerting greater mass effect on descending airways\nserving the\nright lower lobe, some of which are now occluded.\n\n3. Patchy new peribronchovascular consolidation in the right\nlower lobe, most\nsuspicious for post-obstructive pneumonia.\n\n4. Interlobular septal thickening in each lower lobe, more\nprominent on the\nright than left. The appearance may reflect fluid overload or\nlymphatic\ncongestion, but the possibility of lymphangitic carcinomatosis\non the\nright should also be considered.\n\n5. NG tube terminating in the stomach, but with the sidehole\nnear the GE\njunction. If clinically indicated, it could be advanced to gain\nbetter\npurchase in the stomach.\n\n[**2164-2-20**]\nSuccessful paracentesis yielding two liters of clear amber\nfluid.\nSamples were sent to microbiology and cytology.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n81y/o M with metastatic non-small cell lung  cancer on\nchemotherapy with Alimta last given on [**1-31**] who presents with\nabdominal pain and SOB.\n.\n#. Shortness of breath:  This was likely multifactorial, with\ncontributions from COPD, extensive lung cancer disease burden,\npossible post-obstructive pneumonia, and increased abdominal\ngirth. CTA chest negative for PE but showed tumor invasion of\nbronchi and pulmonary artery. NG tube for decompression was\nplaced, vancomycin and zosyn were started, and he was given\nstanding nebulizer treatments and supplemental O2. He underwent\ntwo 2-L paracenteses with some improvement in shortness of\nbreath. Several days into his hospital course he developed\nepisodes of chest pain and increased shortness of breath without\nEKG changes, responsive to nitroglycerin and morphine. These\nwere thought to represent unstable angina with a possible\ncontribution from aspiration events.  Goals of care were\ndiscussed with the palliative care team and eventually revised\nto include comfort measures only.  Antibiotics were stopped.\nMorphine was given to help with shortness of breath and\nnitroglycerin as needed for comfort.\n.\n#. Abdominal distention: Found to have new ascites in setting of\nworsening metastatic disease to liver and omentum. Also found to\nhave ileus in setting of this and combination of these is likely\ncontributing to his worsening discomfort. Surgery evaluated pt.\nin ED and were not concerned for SBO. NGT was placed for\ncomfort.  He was found to have c diff, which was treated with PO\nvanc and zosyn.  He underwent two 2-L paracenteses under\nultrasound guidance.  Antibiotics were stopped when goals of\ncare were revised to CMO.\n.\n#. Leukocytosis: WBC on admission 88K rose to \u003e100k during this\nadmission, increased from 68K on [**2-10**]. This had been discussed\nwith heme/onc in the past and previously attributed to his\ncancer.   The acute rise may have been related to infections (c\ndiff, possible pneumonia).  After goals of care were revised,\nlabs were no longer checked.\n.\n#. Non-small cell lung cancer: Widely metastatic with worsening\ndisease despite Alimta. Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Palliative\ncare assisted in discussions with the family and the goals of\ncare were revised to comfort when it became clear that no\nfurther reasonable therapeutic options were available.

In addition, he\nhad poor mental status as he was drousy and difficult to arouse.\n The patient would respond to commands but then would dose off\nimmediately.  He was on the verge of intubation given his work\nof breathing and mental status.  He received Duonebs x 3 with\nsome improvement.  He also received subQ epinephrine,\nmethyprednisolone, benedryl and magnesium, to which he responded\nwell to.  He was placed on heliox (80/20) with subsequent\nimprovement in his lung exam, respiratory rate, and oxygen\nsaturation (up to 93%).  Labwork was pertinent for positive\nurine benzos, a peripheral eosinophilia (has had in the past),\nand normal electrolytes.

Respiratory distress: Given history of asthma, eosinophila,\nand response to duonebs/steroids, asthma exacerbation is a\npossibility.  Bronchospasm secondary to drug use or inflammatory\netiology is also possible.  He was treated with heliox,\nalbuterol neb q3hr and po steroid.  His O2 saturation was \u003e 93%\non face mask.  Cardiac event less likely given age and negative\nenzymes.  No evidence of pneumonia either clinically or\nradiographically.  We entertained possibility of PE and\nendocarditis, but work up was terminated after patient left AMA\nafter morning round.  Given peripheral eosinophilia, also\nentertained possibility of underlying interstitial process from\ninhalation exposure.\n.\n2. Altered mental status: Serum tox was negative (including\nalcohol) but urine toxicology positive for benzos, which would\ncause altered mental status but not acute SOB and tachypnea.\nhad normal pupil exam and was negative for opoids so he did not\nget narcan in the ED.  He does have a history of untreated\nhepatitis C making encephalopathy a consideration but he does\nnot have any stigmata of chronic liver disease on exam\n(asterixis, jaundice, spider angiomas, etc).

We arranged social\nworker consult, but pt left AMA.\n.\nCHRONIC ISSUES\n1. Depression: Patient has establish diagnosis of mood disorder.\n Currently on seroquel, buprenorphine-naloxone, fluoxetine and\nwellbutrin SR.  We continued home fluoxetine and wellbutrin, but\nheld buprenorphine-naloxone given sedating effects.\n.\n2.Hepatitis C: Patient has documented history, but never been\ntreated.\n.\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n# Pt declared a full code on admission\n.\n# AMA - On the AM of HD#2, patient progressively became more\nawake, getting out of bed, aggressive and cursing nursing staff.\n Pt was alert and oriented on exam shortly prior to the\nescalation, and was deemed competent to make medical decisions.\nBoth nursing staff and housestaff explained the current medical\nsituation and rational for medical decision.  However, patient\ncontinues to be uncooperative.  He pulled his iv access, dressed\nhimself, and became verbally abusive. Security was called, and\naccompanied his departure from the MICU.

A chest computerized tomography scan\nin [**Month (only) 1096**] showed 5 cm ascending aortic aneurysm and a 5 mm\nleft upper lobe nodule.  An echocardiogram in [**2158-9-11**]\nshowed left ventricular function, normal bicuspid aortic\nvalve, mild aortic insufficiency.  The patient's\ntransesophageal echocardiogram showed a aortic root was\ndilated 4.8 cm.\n\nPAST MEDICAL/SURGICAL HISTORY:  Significant for total\nabdominal hysterectomy in [**2155**], carcinoid resection of the\nlung in [**2154**], lumpectomy of the breast for cancer times two\nin [**2154**], neuroma removal, right foot in [**2145**] and tubal\nligation in [**2141**].\n\nMEDICATIONS:  At home she takes Tamoxifen 25 mg q.d., Aspirin\n81 mg once a day and some over-the-counter medications.\n\nALLERGIES:  She has no known drug allergies.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination revealed systolic\nejection murmur, Grade [**1-15**].\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was on the Cardiac Service on\n[**2159-1-15**] and was taken to the Operating Room on\n[**1-16**] with the diagnosis of basically an aortic valve\nrepair, a Bentall procedure with homograft.  Postoperatively\nthe patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit and\nwas doing well.  The following day her lytes were weaned and\nshe was extubated and transferred to the floor on\npostoperative day #2.  On the floor her lytes were repleted\nand she suffered no unusual episodes.  Her wires were\ndiscontinued as well as her chest tube without incident.\nPost pull x-ray did not reveal any pneumothorax.  Of\nsignificance was a hematocrit which had fallen to 20 from her\nsurgery and rose to 22 on [**1-19**] and then continued to\nincrease at discharge.  [**2159-1-20**] laboratory data\nrevealed a hematocrit of 22.8.  The patient has tolerated the\nprocedure well.

He later underwent\nreimplantation of his AICD/PPM in [**8-29**] but now requires an LV\nlead for biventricular pacing to help reduce his heart failure\nsymptoms. Over the past 1.5 months he has become profoundly\ndyspneic with minimal activity and has severe peripheral edema.\nGiven the worsening of\nhis heart failure symptoms, he has been referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**]\nfor LV lead placement for biventricular pacing.\n\nPast Medical History:\n1.

The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the\nanesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related\ncomplications.\nConclusions\nThe left atrium is moderately dilated. No spontaneous echo\ncontrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or\nleft atrial appendage. The right atrium is moderately dilated.\nNo atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The left\nventricular cavity is severely dilated. Overall left ventricular\nsystolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25 %). [Intrinsic\nleft ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed\ngiven the severity of valvular regurgitation.] The right\nventricular cavity is markedly dilated with severe global free\nwall hypokinesis. There are simple atheroma in the descending\nthoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear\nstructurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic\nregurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.\nMild to moderate ([**12-22**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate\n[2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary\nartery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.\nPRELIMINARY REPORT developed by a Cardiology Fellow.

There is no pulmonary edema. Severe\ncardiomegaly is stable\npostoperatively and comparable to the preoperative appearance.\nThere is no\npulmonary edema. Mild right peribronchial opacification could be\natelectasis.\nLeft pleural thickening which developed postoperatively is\nunchanged. It\nwould be very useful to get conventional chest radiographs of\nthis patient to assess the significance of left pleural\nabnormality and the right infrahilar opacification. There is no\npneumothorax or mediastinal widening.\nThe course of the right subclavian transvenous pacer and pacer\ndefibrillator leads are not clear, but the tip of the\ndefibrillator projects over the floor of the right ventricle, as\nbefore.\nDR.

Please see\nDr[**Last Name (STitle) 5305**] operative note for further details. He tolerated\nthe procedure well and was transferred to the CVICU intubated,\nsedated, in critical but stable condition. He awoke\nneurologically intact and was extubated without difficulty.\nAcute pain services was following postoperatively due to\nMr.[**Known lastname 26270**] epidural. He was weaned off the epidural and placed\non oral pain medications. Home cardiac medications were resumed\nand due to hypotension his antihypertensives were stopped. All\nlines and drains were discontinued in a timely fashion. He\nremained in the CVICU for close observation of his renal\nfunction as his Creatinine rose transiently from his already\nelevated baseline. Renal was consulted for acute tubular\nnecrosis. He continued to progress and was transferred to the\nstep down unit for further monitoring. Physical and occupational\ntherapy was consulted for strength and mobility evaluation.

Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system\nrevealed\nthree vessel disease.  The LMCA had no angiogarphically apparent\nflow\nlimiting disease.  The LAD had a total occlusion in the proximal\n\nsegment.  The LCX mid segment through the take off of the second\nOM was\ndiffusely diseased with up to 60% stenosis.  The first OM had a\n60%\nstenosis.  The RCA proximal segment was diffusely diseased with\n80%\nstenosis.  The RCA distal segment had a 90% stenosis, with small\ndistal\nvessels.\n2. Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated normal systemic\npressure\nwith central aortic pressure 125/68 mm Hg.\n3. Successful PTCA and stenting of the proximal LAD total\nocclusion with\na 2.5x23mm Minivision stent that was postdilated to 2.5mm. Final\n\nangiography revealed no residual stenosis, no angiographically\napparent\ndissection and TIMI III flow.\n\nFINAL DIAGNOSIS:\n1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.\n2. Normal systemic arterial pressure.\n3. Successful stenting of the proximal LAD.\n4. Anterior STEMI of unknown duration.\n.\n[**2156-3-13**] ECHO\nThe left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left\nventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There\nis moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with\nakinesis of the mid to distal anterior wall, anterior septum and\nthe apex and hypokinesis of the distal inferior segment. A left\nventricular mass/thrombus cannot be excluded. Tissue Doppler\nimaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure\n(PCWP\u003e18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall\nmotion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,\nascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets\n(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No\naortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are\nmildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. Mild to\nmoderate ([**2-6**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic\nshadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be\nsignificantly UNDERestimated.] There is mild pulmonary artery\nsystolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.\n.\nIMPRESSION: moderate focal LV systolic dysfunction consistent\nwith large LAD infarction. Diastolic dysfunction. At least mild\nto moderate mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary artery\nhypertension.\n.\n[**2156-3-13**] CXR\nIMPRESSION: Tiny left apical PTX. Left lower lobe atelectasis.\nPA catheter\nas described above.\n.\n[**2156-3-14**] CXR\nIMPRESSION: Increased density in the right upper lung zone with\nthe exception of a relative lucent [**Name2 (NI) **]. I suspect pneumothorax\nmay have increased - Inspiratory and expiratory films are\nrecommended. Increased airspace density could be explained by\nsome asymmetric edema. I also suspect increased atelectasis at\nthe left base.\n.\n[**2156-3-15**] CT ABD/CHEST/PELV\nIMPRESSIONS:\n1. PA catheter from left subclavian approach terminates in the\nleft pulmonary artery.\n2. Likely organized hematoma anterior to superior portion of\nleft upper lobe, just inferior to left subclavian puncture site.\n\n3. Moderate right and moderate- to- large left pleural effusion,\nwith\nslightly increased density of the left pleural effusion, likely\nrepresenting some component of hemothorax.\n4. Collapsed left lower lobe and lingula, and atelectasis along\nthe posterior right lower lobe. Patchy consolidation and\nground-glass opacity in the left upper lobe, likely atelectasis\nalthough infection cannot be excluded.\n5. Delayed nephrograms, likely relating to underlying renal\ninsufficiency.\n6. Cholelithiasis.\n7. Mild stranding in the right groin region, likely\npost-procedural; no\nretroperitoneal hematoma seen.\n.\n[**2156-3-23**] - chest x-ray (PRELIM READ)- No change in appearance of\nthe chest compared to [**2156-3-22**] including left apical\npneumothorax.\n.\nShoulder x-ray [**2156-3-22**] - FINDINGS: Four views of the shoulder\ndemonstrate the shoulder in good alignment without fracture or\ndislocation. As described on the chest x-ray, there is an\nalveolar infiltrate in the left upper lobe and left loculated\npneumothorax. These findings were discussed with the house staff\ncaring for the patient at the time of dictating this report.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n72 yo female with diabetes presenting with STEMI, s/p PCI to\nLAD. Course complicated after Swan placement with hemothorax\nrequiring chest tube placement now s/p chest tube removal being\nevaluated for rehab placement.\n.\n# CORONARIES: Patient presented with a STEMI, found to have\nculprit lesion in LAD on cath, S/P BMS to LAD.  Cardiac enzymes\ntrending down. Patient was changed from low dose simvastatin to\nfull strength atorvastatin in the setting of acute MI. In\naddition, patient placed on full strength aspirin and started on\nplavix. Patient was started on beta blocker after hemodynamics\nnormalized and increased as tolerated by blood pressure.\nInitially post-STEMI patient was found to be tachycardic and\nhypotensive which improved with fluid administration. Initially\nbeta blocker was held in the setting of recent STEMI and with\nhypotension and restarted when patient was hemodynamically\nstable.\n.\n# Hemothorax / pneumothorax - Patient had subclavian line placed\nin the context of ICU admission which was complicated by\nhemothorax. Thoracic surgery was consulted and a chest tube was\nplaced. Initially chest tube was placed to suction and\neventually weaned to water seal.  Patient required 4U pRBC after\n1.5L blood removed from chest tube. Patient had chest tube\nremoved on [**2156-3-20**] and subsequently had a persistent left apical\nPTX.  Pneumothorax initially was stable and then appeared to\nincrease in size. Reconsulted thoracic surgery regarding apical\npneumothorax and recommended repeating films to demonstrate\nstability.  Patient had daily hcts drawn and prior to discharge\nhad stable crit for three days.\n.\n# Fever: Patient spiked fever overnight 2/13-14/09. UA revealed\nUTI, urine culture with Klebsiella pneumonia. Blood cultures no\ngrowth to date. Chest x-ray without acute new infiltrate.\nPatient without productive cough. No diarhea. C. diff negative\nx1. STarted ciprofloxacin for UTI.  Patient without symptoms.\nDiscontinued foley and changed patient to tylenol PRN from\nstanding in order to better monitor fever curve.  In addition,\nthere is an opacity in the RLL on CXR which could be atelectasis\nfrom PTX but concerning for PNA([**3-21**]). Following for now as UTI\nis a more likely explanation for fever.\n.\n# PUMP ?????? Patient with ischemic cardiomyopathy with LVEF 30-35%.\nMild pulmonary artery hypertension. Repeat echo on admission\ndemonstrates LV apical hypokinesis so there is risk for LV\nthrombus.  Patient was started on IV heparin.  Coumadin was\ninitiated after the chest tube was removed and hematocrit was\nstable.  INR now 2.1, so no additional heparin needed on\ndischarge.  Patient with coumadin with goal INR [**3-9**].  Of note,\ndiscussed anticoagulation with outpt opthalmologist given risk\nof vitreous hemorrhage and no contraindication to coumadin from\nophthalmologic perspective.  Given low EF attempted to keep\npatient even to negative.  Patient maintained on aspirin,\nstatin, beta blocker.  Initially held ACE inhitor given acute\nrenal failure which was improved back to baseline and ACEI\nrestarted.\n\n# LUE swelling- Patient noted to have left upper extremity\nswelling greater than right which is now resolved. Of note,\npatient had CVL on that side. LUE US negative for clot so likely\njust third spacing of fluid assymetric.\n.\n# ARF now resolved: Cr increased since admission from 0.9 to\n2.3, now improved to baseline (1.2). Etiology likely secondary\nto hypotension vs. constrast induced nephropathy.  Patient\nmaintained good urine output. Initially held ACE inhibitor in\nthe setting of ARF which was restarted when renal function\nimproved.  Medications were renally dosed and nephrotoxins were\navoided.\n.\n# Rhythm: NS for now with some atrial ectopy. No events of\ntelemetry. Patient was continued on telemetry.\n.\n# Diabetes - Continue glargine, sliding scale, diabetic diet\n.\n# Chronic pain and acute pain ?????? controlled, patient states she\nhas not needed chronic pain medications. INitially pain\nmanagement with long acting morphine in the context of chest\ntube. After chest tube removal patient did not require chronic\nnarcotics. Discontinued MS contin and using Percoset for\nbreakthrough pain. Patient evaluated by physical therapy for\nknee pain.\n.\nFEN:  Heart-healthy, low-sodium, diabetic diet\n.\nACCESS: PIV's, PICC placed [**2156-3-17**] and d/c on day of discharge\n.\nPROPHYLAXIS:  PPI, bowel regimen, coumadin\n.\nCODE: Full\n\nMedications on Admission:\n#.

Hypercholesterolemia.\n\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Medications include\nhydrochlorothiazide, Aggrastat, captopril, Lipitor,\nLopressor, aspirin, amlodipine.\n\nALLERGIES:  The patient states no known drug allergies.\n\nLABORATORY VALUES ON ADMISSION:  A white blood cell count\nof 10,000, hematocrit of 39, a platelet count of 241.\nSodium 139, potassium 3.7, chloride 98, bicarbonate 28,\nBUN 19, creatinine 1.5.\n\nRADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   The patient's cardiac catheterization\nwhich was performed on [**2192-6-21**], revealed left main and\nnative 3-vessel coronary artery disease as well as\nsignificant in-stent stenosis of two of his vein grafts.  It\nalso showed that his left internal mammary artery graft to\nhis left anterior descending artery was patent, and the\npatient underwent successful percutaneous transluminal\ncoronary angioplasty of the occluded saphenous vein graft to\nthe right coronary artery which was occluded.  At that time\nit was also noted that the patient had moderate left\nsubclavian stenosis.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was initially seen by\nCardiothoracic Surgery Service who felt the patient was a\nsignificant high risk for redo revascularization procedure.\n\nThe patient continued to have chest pain over the next few\ndays as he was attempting to be managed medically by the\nCardiology Service.  For a second opinion, a Cardiothoracic\nconsultation was obtained by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1537**] who felt that\nsurgical revascularization was possible.  This was initially\nscheduled to occur on [**2192-6-25**]; however, this was\npostponed for a significant number of days because of a rise\nin creatinine after the cardiac catheterization procedure.\n\nThe patient remained on the Cardiology Medicine Service and\nwas managed medically while daily laboratory values were\nbeing evaluated due to rise in creatinine and concern for\nworsening renal failure.\n\nOn [**2192-7-2**], a Renal Medicine consultation was obtained,\nand it was their impression that this was acute on chronic\nrenal failure possibly from the dye involved with the\ncatheterization procedure.  They felt that there was no\nindication for dialysis at that time but to continue to\nmonitor his BUN and creatinine as well as his potassium.  It\nwas their recommendation to proceed with the cardiac\nrevascularization thinking that increased cardiac output\nwould help his renal function.\n\nThe patient was taken to the angiography suite on [**2192-7-4**], and underwent renal angiography which demonstrated\nmoderate right renal artery stenosis without functional flow\nlimitation.  He was taken for this procedure with the hope of\npossibly stenting the renal artery.  This was something to\nbenefit the patient; however, since there was no functional\nflow limitation, this was not done.\n\nThe patient was informed of the high likelihood of requiring\nhemodialysis after the cardiac surgical procedure because of\nhis worsening renal function after cardiac catheterization,\nand the patient and his wife both accepted that as a risk in\ngoing into the procedure.\n\nThe patient was taken to the operating room on [**2192-7-6**],\nwhere he underwent redo coronary artery bypass graft times\none using a vein to the obtuse marginal, and this was done\noff pump.\n\nPostoperatively, the patient was transported from the\noperating room to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit on\nnitroglycerin and propofol intravenous drips.  The patient\nwas weaned and extubated from mechanical ventilator on the\nnight of surgery.\n\nOn postoperative day one the patient remained hemodynamically\nstable.  His pulmonary artery catheter was discontinued as\nwas his chest tube, and he was transfused 1 unit of packed\nred blood cells, and the Renal Service continued to follow\nhim.  On the night of postoperative day one, on [**2192-7-8**], the patient did complain of bilateral arm pain\nradiating to his hands with some vague chest discomfort.  The\npatient was also somewhat hypertensive at that time.  He was\nplaced on nitroglycerin due to possible ischemia as well as\nhypertension control.  The patient also had an episode of\natrial fibrillation for which he was treated with intravenous\nLopressor.\n\nThe patient underwent an urgent echocardiogram to evaluate\nfor any wall motion abnormalities that may be associated with\nthis episode of chest pain on [**2192-7-8**], and the\nechocardiogram demonstrated normal wall motion with an\nejection fraction of 55%.  It was felt the patient did not\nneed to go to the catheterization laboratory to assess\npatency of his graft.  The patient remained hemodynamically\nstable.\n\nOn postoperative day three, [**2192-7-9**], he underwent his\nfirst hemodialysis treatment which he tolerated well with the\nexception of an episode of atrial fibrillation which was\ntreated with intravenous Lopressor, which converted him to\nnormal sinus rhythm.  An Electrophysiology consultation was\nobtained on [**2192-7-9**], due to the atrial fibrillation and\nthe question of whether the patient should be started on\namiodarone was addressed.  It was their recommendation that\nif he had a further episode of atrial fibrillation to begin\namiodarone.  This occurred on the following day, [**2192-7-10**], and amiodarone was started.  The patient underwent a\nsecond hemodialysis treatment on [**2192-7-10**], which he\ntolerated well.\n\nThe patient was transferred out of the Cardiothoracic\nIntensive Care Unit to the telemetry floor on [**7-10**], and\nremained hemodynamically stable.  The patient's had been\nfollowed closely by the Renal Medicine Service over the next\nfew days, and has gone for his dialysis treatments three\ntimes a week.\n\nThe patient was seen by Psychiatry staff on [**2192-7-13**],\nfor evaluation of depression as well as intermittent period\nof delirium.  It was their recommendation to discontinue\nbenzodiazepines as well as other sedating medications and to\ncontinue to manage the patient's metabolic abnormalities as\nwell as possible.  The patient's intermittent mental status\nchanges resolved and he has been lucid over the next few\ndays.\n\nOn [**2192-7-16**], the patient remained hemodynamically\nstable.  Rehabilitation screen was requested since it was\napparent that the patient was getting to not needing acute\nhospitalization any further.\n\nToday, [**2192-7-17**], the patient went to hemodialysis unit\nand due to difficult flow in his left Perm-A-Cath ...........\nwas instilled, and the catheter has been patent.  The patient\nwas dialyzed today, and he will have a dialysis treatment\nonce more tomorrow ([**7-18**]) prior to being discharged from\nthe hospital.\n\nThe patient had also been initiated on Coumadin starting,\nactually, on [**2192-7-11**], due three postoperative episodes\nof atrial fibrillation.  His most recent INR was 1.4 on\n[**2192-7-16**], and 1.8 today ([**2192-7-17**]).  The patient\nreceived 5 mg on [**7-15**], 5 mg on [**7-16**], and 3 mg on\n[**7-17**].  His target INR should be 2.5.\n\nToday the patient also complained of some abdominal\ndiscomfort and intermittent nausea.  Amylase and lipase were\nchecked, and his amylase was 102 and lipase was 88.  The\npatient also claimed that he felt constipated and was\nattributing his abdominal complaints to this.  His abdomen\nwas soft, nondistended, minimal tenderness to palpation, and\nhe had positive bowel sounds and positive flatus.\n\nPhysical examination today is as follows:  His temperature\nis 96.7, his pulse is 68, his respiratory rate is 20.  His\nblood pressure is 154/70, his oxygen saturation is 96% on\nroom air.  His weight today is 62.5 kg which is below his\npreoperative weight of 70 kg.  Neurologically, the patient is\nalert and oriented, although depressed.  His coronary\nexamination has a regular rate and rhythm.  His is in normal\nsinus rhythm.  His lungs are clear to auscultation\nbilaterally.  His sternum is stable.  His incisions are\nclean, dry and intact.  His abdomen is soft with positive\nbowel sounds.\n\nMost recent laboratory values from [**7-16**] which include a\nhematocrit of 31.4.  Sodium 129, potassium 5.3, chloride 89,\nBUN 137, creatinine 7.3, glucose of 122.  Laboratories from\n[**7-17**] include an amylase of 102, lipase 88, PT 16.5,\nINR 1.8.\n\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:\n 1.  Amiodarone 400 mg p.o. b.i.d. until [**2192-7-23**]; then\nhe is to decrease to 400 mg p.o. q.d. times one week; and\nthen to 200 mg p.o. q.d.; and then as directed by his primary\ncare cardiologist.\n 2.

He last\nused cocaine 4 days PTA, noting worsening hiccups, induced\nvomiting with coffee ground emesis associated with nausea,\nsubxiphoid abdominal pain, and chills. In ED \u003e500 cc coffee\nground emesis, sbp transiently decreased to 90 with improvement\nwith 250 cc NS bolus. He received [**Last Name (LF) 28920**], [**First Name3 (LF) **], Protonix, KCl, 2\nL NS, and dilaudid and a RIJ was placed. He refused NG lavage.\nOf note, cards saw pt given new RBBB, who recommended no acute\nintervention at this time. Pt was admitted to ICU for\nmonitoring. Shortly after arriving to ICU, he underwent an EGD,\nwhich noted a large clot in middle third of esophagus and lower\nthird of the esophagus with clotted blood and coffee grounds (1L\nremoved) and small amounts of fresh blood. The EGD was aborted\nwhen he became hypotensive w/ MAP ~ 40. He was intubated for\nairway protection, with approximately 1L bloody emesis suctioned\nafter intubation. A right femoral a-line and left femoral cordis\nwere placed. He received 3 LNS and 3 u PRBC as well as\nneosynephrine gtt w/ improvement in MAPs to 70. A repeat EGD\nshowed clotted blood in the middle [**11-22**] of the esophagus with\nassociated oozing. Epinephrine was injected under the clot and\nthe clot was removed. However, no underlying lesion was\nvisualized that could account for the bleeding. He subsequently\nremained hemodynamically stable with stable hematocrit over the\nnext 24 hours.

EGD was\nsignificant for blood clot with oozing, as described in the HPI.\nThe clot was removed and he was stabilized in the MICU\novernight. Following clot removal he remained hemodynamically\nstable without evidence of bleed. Hematocrit remained stable at\n31-32 over the next 24 hours. He was transferred to the medicine\nservice where he had no further evidence of GI bleed. Hematocrit\nremained stable without requirement of further blood tranfusion.\nHe will have repeat EGD in 2 weeks with gastroenterology.\n\n2) Hypotension: Developed transient systolic blood pressures in\nthe 90's in the ED, likely representing hypovolemia in setting\nof large volume GI bleed. During EGD, his MAP fell to the 40's\nas outlined in the HPI. He was initially treated with IVF and\npressor support in addition to 4 units of PRBCs. Following\nhemostasis, he was able to be weaned off pressors while\nmaintaining stable blood pressures. Initially,  infection was\nconsidered as a potential etiology. Given his leukocytosis and\nrisk for aspiration he was started empirically on levo/flagyl\nfor aspiration pneumonia. However, this was subsequently\ndiscontinued prior to transfer to the medicine service since he\nhad no evidence of pneumonia by CXR. Blood cultures and Urine\ncultures were negative.\n\n3) RBBB: Seen on EKG in the ED, which was new since his NSTEMI\nat OSH, but he was noted to have previous evidence of RBBB in\nthe setting of tachycardia. He was evaluated by cardiology who\nfelt no acute interventio was indicated. He subsequently ruled\nout for acute ischemic event with 3 sets of negative cardiac\nenzymes.\n\n4) Hypertension: Once his blood pressure normalized, he was\nre-started on his outpatient regimen of lisinopril, HCTZ and\ntriamterene. Toprol XL was held due to his ongoing cocaine\nabuse. His blood pressures on this regimen were 100-110\nsystolic. Given his pre-load dependence in the setting of his\nmoderate aortic stenosis, in addition to his history of gout,\nthe HCTZ and triamterene were discontinued prior to discharge.\nIn addition, lisinopril was decreased to 40mg qday ([**11-21**] his\nprevious dose).\n\n5) Right lower lobe pneumonia: The patient developed a new\nleukocytosis, fever (101.8) and mild hypoxia (02 sat at 93%) on\n[**2100-12-14**]. Initial portable CXR showed no evidence of pneumonia\nand the patient defervesced the following morning. Antibiotics\nwere initially held, however repeat CXR PA\u0026Lat showed evidence\nof right lower lobe pneumonia. Therefore he was started on a 7\nday course of levofloxacin. He continued to appear well without\nfever and his WBC count trended back down from 18.6 to 9.8.\n\n6) Hyponatremia: The patient developed hyponatremia with sodium\nfalling acutely from 139 to 123 over a 24 hour period. Primary\npsychogenic polydipsia was suspected given his increased water\nintake. The patient was noted to be drinking large quantities of\nwater to help alleviate his chronic hiccups. He was educated on\nthe dangers of low sodium levels, including possible seizures\nand death, and his water intake was restricted. However, his\nsodium levels continued to drop precariously to 111. Aggressive\nwater restriction was continued and his sodium normalized\nquickly to 132 by the end of the day. Of note, he had no\nevidence of neurologic deficit throughout the day and remained\nalert and oriented and conversational. With persistent education\nand water restriction sodium remained \u003e130 through the remainder\nof his hospital course. He was also seen and evaluated by the\npsychiatry service who felt that he was not trying to\nintentionally harm himself with water ingestion.\n\n7) Hypothyroidism: The patient has known hypothyroidism\nsecondary to resection of his thyroid for medullary thyroid\ncarcinoma. In the ICU on this admission, he was noted to have a\nhigh TSH and low T4. He was initially re-started on levoxyl at\n100mcg qday, which was titrated up to 150mcg. He will follow-up\nwith Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1968**] in one month for repeat thyroid function tests.\n\n8) Intractable Hiccups: He has known intractable hiccups for the\nlast 4 years, treated with multiple regimens. Most recently he\nhad a vagal nerve stimulator (VNS) placed in [**10-23**] through Dr.\n[**Last Name (STitle) 28921**]. His hiccups returned despite the VNS and he again\nbegan to self-induce vomiting in order to help with alleviation\nof his hiccups. He has had previous [**Doctor First Name 329**] [**Doctor Last Name **] tears in this\nsetting, and it was felt that his GI bleed on this admission was\nalso secondary to [**Doctor First Name 329**] [**Doctor Last Name **] tear. He was seen by Dr.\n[**Last Name (STitle) 28921**] again on this hospital stay. His stimulator voltage\nwas increased to 1.5 V (from 0.5) and set to fire every 5\nminutes. His hiccups were controlled on this regimen. He has had\na great deal of relief on this new setting. However, he does\ncomplain of cough which is a side effect of the stimulator. He\nwill follow-up with Neurosurgery on [**12-30**].\n\n9) Type II DM: well-controlled on sliding scale insulin regimen\nand diabetic diet.\n\n10)Nutrition: He was evaluated by the speech and swallow service\nand he passed swallowing study without evidence of aspiration.\nHe was started on a ground diabetic diet and tolerated this\nwell. Boost supplement was added with meals and electrolytes\nwere supplemented daily as needed.\n\n11)h/o CAD: Unknown coronary anatomy given his aborted heart\ncatheritization. However he does have history of NSTEMI,\npossibly in the setting of cocaine abuse. Aspirin was initially\nheld secondary to his [**Doctor First Name 329**] [**Doctor Last Name **] tear. After discussion with\nGI it was recommended that aspirin may be re-started upon\ndischarge (one week post GI bleed). As mentioned above,\nB-blocker was held due to his h/o cocaine abuse and concern over\nunopposed alpha adrenergic stimulation.\n\n12) Cocaine abuse: The patient admitted to use 4 days prior to\nadmission. He initially agreed to seek help for his use,\nincluding consultation with social work and the addictions\nservice. However he subsequently declined return to rehab.\n\n13) Depression: The patient was seen and evaluated by the\npsychiatry service. It was felt that the patient was likely\nclinically depressed and would benefit from re-start of his\npaxil. This was re-started on [**12-15**]. In addition, f/u with mental\nhealth was recommened in the outpatient setting.\n\n14) Insomnia: Difficulty falling asleep secondary to hiccups,\ncough. Somewhat alleviated with 5mg ambien prn. Hopefully will\nhave some relief now that hiccups are resolved. Given a 15 dose\nprescription for short-term control, but recommended that this\nbe followed up with his PCP.\n\n15) Lower back pain: Unclear etiology. He reports that the pain\nis chronic for him, most likely from chronic arthritis. He also\nhas evidence of osteoarthritis in his hand. Controlled with\npercocet prn.\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\n[**Month/Year (2) **] 325mg qday, Paroxetine 20mg qday, metoprolol XL 100mg qday,\nlosartan 40mg qday, triamtere/HCTZ 50/25qday, Lisinopril 40mg\n[**Hospital1 **], Senna 8.6 mg [**Hospital1 **] prn, Omeprazole 20mg [**Hospital1 **], Levothyroxine\n0.3mg qday, allopurinol 300mg qday, Flonase 50mg 2sprays qday,\nIron 325mg [**Hospital1 **], NPH 20units qam,Reg 4 units qam\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.

Overall left\nventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25-30\n%) secondary to akinesis of the entire septum and apex, and\nmoderate global hypokinesis of the remaining segments. The\nbasal-mid lateral wall contracts best. Right ventricular chamber\nsize is normal. with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall.\nThe aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with\ngood leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic\nregurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly\nthickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The left\nventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling\nabnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. Moderate [2+]\ntricuspid regurgitation is seen.

Ruled in for STEMI at\nOSH \u0026 subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cath.\n\nACUTE DIAGNOSES:\n# NSTEMI: Found to have peak troponin to 2.76 at OSH with T wave\nchanges in V2-V5.\nTransferred on heparin gtt. Pt was continued on metoprolol,\nstatin, ASA. Loaded with plavix prior to cath on [**2123-1-14**] which\nshowed minimal in-stent restenosis of RCA stent, as well as a\ntight ostial LAD on which PCI could not be performed (too\ndifficult). Pt had radial access for arterial cath; venous\naccess in groin difficult to obtain. Patient hypotensive during\ncase, requiring dopamine gtt temporarily (now off pressors).\nAfterward, patient developed rapidly expanding left groin\nhematoma. She was given protamine. Hematoma now stable,\nhematocrit 29 on discharge (stable for days). Patient also\ndyspnea, requiring O2 4L per NC, and appears somewhat volume\noverloaded. Patient admitted to CCU for diuresis and observation\novernight. B/L LE US were negative for hematoma, non-contrast CT\nabdomen and pelvis were negative for RP bleed.  In the CCU,\npatient was continued on ASA 325mg PO, Atorvastatin 80mg PO\ndaily, Metoprolol tartrate 50mg PO BID, plavix.  Amlodipine was\ndiscontinued and lisinopril was held due to hypotension/low\nurine output.  On the floor, patient started on diovan 40 mg,\nwhich should be held if her blood pressure is less than 100.\nDischarged on full ASA, plavix, metoprolol succinate 100 mg QD.\n\n# LEFT GROIN HEMATOMA: Developed apparent right groin hematoma\nwhich was treated with protamine. CT [**Last Name (un) 103**] showed pt actually had\nleft groin hematoma, none on right. No pseudoaneurysm/RP bleed.\nHematoma and hematocrit remained stable throughout CCU \u0026 floor\ncourse. DPs dopplerable BL. Patient was maintained on\npneumoboots instead of heparin sq prophylaxis.\n\n# Acute on Chronic Systolic CHF: CXR showed pulmonary\nengorgement \u0026 bilateral effusions with compressive atelectasis.\nPt was given IV lasix prior to going to the cath lab. A TTE was\nperformed that showed severe global hypokinesis \u0026 akinesis of\nentire septum \u0026 apex.  LVEF 25-30%.  Prior ECHO shows EF 40-45%\nin [**2116**]. During catheterization, pt was hypotensive \u0026 required\ndopamine gtt.  She was transferred to the CCU for transient\nhypotension requiring dopamine in the catheterization lab. Ms.\n[**Known lastname 13143**] was normotensive on the floor. Diovan was started on\nthe floor as above.  Lasix will not be reinitiated on discharge.\n\nCHRONIC DIAGNOSES:\n# COPD/Emphysema: Pt was continued on her course of\nazithromycin. There was no concern for acute exacerbatin given\ngood air movement \u0026 lack of wheeze.\n\n# PVD: continued on aspirin \u0026 plavix.\n\n# Seizure disorder: Last seizure was on [**2120**].  He was continued\non home keppra 1500mg [**Hospital1 **], but pharmacy recommended switching\nher dose based on her renal function.  The recommended dose\n(based on creatinine clearance) is 750 mg [**Hospital1 **].  This was\nexplained to the patient as she was nervous about the change in\ndose.\n\n# Rheumatoid arthritis:  He was continued on prednisone 5mg PO\ndaily.  Her celebrex was held due to NSTEMI.\n\n# Osteopenia:  He was continued on calcium, vitamin D.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n# Follow-Up:  Upon leaving rehab, the patient should schedule\nfollow up appointments with her cardiologist (Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **])\nand her primary care doctor.\n\n# Code Status: DNR/DNI.

The inferior mesenteric artery is patent.\nIncidental note\nis made of a replaced right hepatic artery.\n\nThere is no evidence of active hemorrhage within the small/large\nbowel loops.\nProminent vessels are seen along the wall of the cecum and\nproximal ascending\ncolon, without evidence of active bleed.\n\nNo significant retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy is\nseen.\n\nMultiple hypodense lesions are seen in both kidneys, consistent\nwith simple\nrenal cysts, with the largest in the lower pole of the right\nkidney measuring\n3.9 cm and the largest exophytic cyst in the lower pole of the\nleft kidney\nmeasuring 5.4 cm. Both kidneys enhance and excrete contrast\nsymmetrically.\nMild right hydroureteronephrosis has progressed since the prior\nstudy and\nureter is dilated up to the level of the pelvic inlet and likely\nrelates to\npost-radiation changes.\n\nThe spleen and pancreas are normal. The right adrenal gland is\nnormal.\nNodular thickening of the left adrenal gland, is stable since\nthe earlier\nstudy of [**2148-9-11**].\n\nCT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Multiple stones seen\nalong the\ndependent aspect of the urinary bladder, likely relate to\nchronic outlet\nobstruction. Diffuse thickening of the rectal wall with\nperirectal fat\nstranding, likely represent post-radiation changes. Evidence of\nprior\nsurgical anastomosis is seen in the the rectum. Small bilateral\nlymph nodes\nseen along the external iliac chain do not meet CT criteria for\nsignificant\nadenopathy and are stable since the prior study. There is no\npelvic free\nfluid.\n\nBONES AND SOFT TISSUES: No bone lesions suspicious for infection\nor\nmalignancy are detected. Moderate degenerative changes are seen\nin the lumbar\nspine, worse at L2-L3 level, with near complete reduction of\ndisc space and\nmild retrolisthesis of L2 on L3 .\n\nIMPRESSION:\n1. No evidence of active gastro-intestinal bleeding.\n2. Bilateral moderate simple pleural effusions with compressive\natelectasis\nof the lung bases.\n3.

These findings are compatible with\nRadiation proctitis. The opening out of the rectum was tight. It\nwas off to the side of the rectal channel. It was found by using\nthe Pedi gastroscope first. Once this lumen was intubated, I\nchanged to the gastroscope. With this scope, got to the hepatic\nflexure. I then changed scopes to the Pedi colonoscope and was\nable to enter the lumen and go to the cecum. The presence of the\nlarge ventral hernia made passage difficult.

Hct remained stable post-EGD and patient was\ncalled out to the floor. While on the floor had continued melena\nand underwent an enteroscopy that was unrevealing. The patient\nwas then prepped for 2 days and underwent a colonscopy that\nrevealed radiation changes to the rectum but no source for brisk\nbleed. The pt received 1pRBC prior to discharge. (His Hct was\nmid 24's prior to the pRBC transfusion). The patient was\ndischarged with plans for a Hct check the day following\ndischarge and to follow-up with [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1939**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1940**] (GI) for a\npotential outpatient capsule endoscopy.\n.\n# Atrial fib: Pt currently in NSR on dofetilide and PRN\nmetoprolol at home.

Per the patient's neurologist's notes, she\ncomplained of feeling weak, and then became unresponsive and\nhad some jerking eye movements to the right.  Her oxygen\nsaturations dropped, and the patient was subsequently\nintubated.  The examination showed response to pain\nbilaterally, and bilateral plantar flexor response.  Initial\nhead CT was negative.  The events occurred at 9 A.M., and the\npatient was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] at approximately noon.\n\nShe was initially admitted to the Medical Intensive Care\nUnit, and then subsequently transferred to the Surgical\nIntensive Care Unit.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:   As above.

She was afebrile, with stable vitals.  The neck\nwas without bruits. Cardiovascular was regular rate and\nrhythm.  The chest was clear to auscultation.  Neurological\nexamination:  Initially the patient was awake, responding\nappropriately to simple questions.  Pupils were small and\nunreactive to light.  Eye movements were intact.  There were\nno horizontal eye movements.  There was decreased tone\nbilaterally.  The patient was able to move her left toes on\ncommand.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was transferred to the\nSurgical Intensive Care Unit after an MRI which revealed a\nleft medulla, left pontine, left cerebellar, and small left\nthalamic infarction.  In the Surgical Intensive Care Unit,\nthe patient was alert and following commands.  Neurologically\nshe remained stable overnight.  However, on the morning of\nthe 15th, the patient's T-max was 100.6.  Vital signs were\notherwise stable on a Neo-Synephrine drip.  The white count\nhad increased to 31, and the patient became minimally\nresponsive, only responding with the left lower extremity to\npainful stimulus.\n\nThe Neurology team was informed, and a head CT was deferred\nat this time.  Throughout the day, the patient remained\nminimally responsive.  After discussion was held with the\nfamily with the Neurology team and the Intensive Care Unit\nteam, the patient was made Do Not Resuscitate/Do Not\nIntubate, and was extubated.  The [**Hospital 228**] health care proxy\nunderstood that this would likely result in the patient's\nexpiration.\n\nShortly after extubation, the patient expired.  The patient\nwas pronounced dead at 10:10 P.M. on [**2124-9-13**].

She was initially admitted to the intensive care unit\nand intubated for airway protection.  An EGD was done which\nrevealed Grade IV esophageal varices.  The varices were [**Month/Day/Year 43652**]\nand the patient was successfully extubated the morning after\nadmission.\n\nThe patient was initiated on an octreotide gtt, which was\ncontinued until she was transferred to the floor.  She was also\ntreated with a five day course of ceftriaxone, which she\ncompleted while in house.  She was started on Nadolol and the\ndose was reduced from 20 mg to 10 mg prior to discharge as the\npatient had some dizziness.  She was also started on both Lasix\nand spironolactone, which were discontinued as her blood\npressure did not tolerate all of the above agents.  Her\nhematocrit remained stable after an initial transfusion of four\nunits of packed red blood cells.  She will follow up for repeat\nbanding with GI.\n\nWhile in the intensive care unit, an ultrasound demonstrated\ncirrhotic liver with re-demonstration of a known hepatocellular\ncarcinoma in the right hepatic lobe as well as near complete\nocclusion of the main portal vein, which had progressed since\nthe ultrasound of [**2150-4-9**].  Unfortunately, the progression of\ndisease and the associated thrombus made the patient ineligible\nfor listing as a transplant candidate.  This was discussed with\nthe patient and with her family on several occasions.\n\nOn the floor, the patient had nausea and vomiting.  She was\ntreated with IV anti-emetics, which resolved her discomfort.  At\ndischarge, she was tolerating PO intake without difficulty and\nhad no further episodes of vomiting.  She was discharged with\nmedications for nausea.\n\nThe patient does not wish to know her diagnosis and thus knows\nshe is no longer a transplant candidate but does not know she\nhas hepatocellular cancer.  Her family is aware of the diagnosis\nand prognosis.  The patient was discharged to home in the care\nof her family, with VNA services and plan for repeat banding as\nan outpatient.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nNadolol 20 mg qdaily\nCompazine 10 mg q6h PRN nausea\nOxycodone 5 mg q4h PRN pain\nDocusate\nSenna\nBisacodyl\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.

He was\nfound to have a severe right sided infiltrate on chest x-ray.  He\nwas ruled out for tuberculosis.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**] ICU on [**2101-6-3**], and intubated\nfor hypoxic respiratory failure.  Originally, he was on\nLevofloxacin and Clindamycin for aspiration pneumonia.  He had\npersistent fevers in the ICU.  Because of his significant travel\nhistory, serologies for coccidioides and strongyloides were sent.\nHe also received Vancomycin for a seven day course.  There was a\nquestion of possible drug fever because of persistent fever and\npersistent elevated peripheral eosinophils.  Clindamycin was\ndiscontinued and he was on Levofloxacin and Flagyl upon transfer\nto the floor.  Malaria workup was negative.  His arterial line\ngrew coagulase negative Staphylococcus and the line was\ndiscontinued.  However, since transfer out of the unit, he has\nbeen afebrile for a total of two days.  He was extubated on\n[**2101-6-13**], with a slow wean likely secondary to his severe chronic\nobstructive pulmonary disease.  He failed video swallow study on\n[**2101-6-13**], and since then has been NPO with a nasogastric tube in\nplace.  He was called out to the ACOVE service and currently was\nwithout any complaints.  He denied chest pain, shortness of\nbreath, headaches, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,\nchange in stool.  He wanted to ambulate.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\n1.

Tube feeds via the nasogastric tube.\n\nALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with his girlfriend,\n[**Name (NI) **] in [**Location (un) **], [**State 350**].  She is also his health\ncare proxy.  [**Name (NI) **] was a former smoker and denies current\nalcohol use.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature is 98.9, heart rate 83 to\n100, blood pressure 107 to 125 over 54 to 60, respiratory\nrate 17 to 23, oxygen saturation 93 to 97% on four to five\nliters oxygen via nasal cannula. In general, the patient is\nalert, oriented times three in chair.  Head, eyes, ears, nose\nand throat - normocephalic and atraumatic.  The pupils are\nequal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation.\nExtraocular movements are intact.  OG tube in place.  Neck -\n2+ carotids, supple, no lymphadenopathy.  Cardiovascular is\nregular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.\nRespiratory - crackles at the right base greater than the\nleft base, some bronchial breath sounds on the right upper\nborder.  The abdomen is normoactive bowel sounds, soft,\nnontender, nondistended.  Extremities no cyanosis, clubbing\nor edema.  Neurologically, cranial nerves II through XII are\nintact with 5/5 strength in the lower extremities and upper\nextremities bilaterally.  Nonfocal examination.\n\nLABORATORY DATA:  Upon transfer to Acove, white blood cell\ncount had come down to 17.8, hematocrit 30.4, platelet count\n1091.  Chem10 was unremarkable. ALT 42, AST 28, alkaline\nphosphatase 160, total bilirubin 0.3.  Differential\nsignificant for 57% polys, 2 bands, 4 lymphocytes, 7\nmonocytes, 28 eosinophils, and 2 basophils.\n\nASSESSMENT:  This is a 61 year old admitted to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**]\nIntensive Care Unit from [**Hospital 48159**] Hospital for hypoxic\nrespiratory failure and severe right sided pneumonia.  Past\nmedical history is significant for throat cancer, status post\nresection/reconstructive surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy\nin remission, history of minor aspirations, chronic obstructive\npulmonary disease, sciatica, malaria which recurs annually\n(former Green Beret).  He was intubated shortly after his\nadmission here and his chest x-ray was significant for infiltrate\nthroughout the right lung.  On transfer to the floor, his severe\naspiration pneumonia was improving both clinically and\nradiographically.  He was doing well on Levaquin and Flagyl.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE:\n1.  Aspiration pneumonia - This was thought to be secondary to\naspiration, however, given his travel history, he was worked up\nfor coccidioidomycosis and histoplasmosis.  At the time of this\ndictation, these serologies are still pending. He was intubated\non [**2101-6-3**], upon admission and extubated on [**2101-6-12**], with a\nslow wean from the ventilator secondary to his severe underlying\nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Radiographically,\ninfiltrates have improved though a couple of areas on the CAT\nscan appear to be possibly evolving abscesses.  Antibiotics were\nchanged around though he was finally placed on Levofloxacin and\nFlagyl.  His course in the ICU was complicated by recurrent\nfevers of unclear etiology. Drug reaction was considered given\nthe peripheral eosinophilia and malaria was also considered but\nparasite smear was negative.  The A line which grew out coagulase\nnegative Staphylococcus was pulled.  While on the floor, he\nwas continued on Levaquin and Flagyl.  His white blood cell\ncount continued to trend down.  He remained afebrile and he\nwas using an incentive spirometer at the bedside.  He\nremained NPO with an OG tube for medications with a plan to\nbe reevaluated by speech and swallow service on Friday, [**2101-6-17**].\nHis reevaluation did demonstrate some improvement from the\ninitial study of [**2101-6-13**].  The patient continues to present with\nsevere to profound pharyngeal dysphagia. ENT was consulted and\nthey recommended as well to either place a percutaneous\nendoscopic gastrostomy tube for feeding and that he was at severe\nrisk for aspiration, to NPO.  They recommended a CT scan of the\noral cavity and neck with contrast to rule out tumor recurrence\nwhich was done and revealed no new mass.  They also recommended\nan outpatient barium swallow to rule out esophageal mass or\nobstruction.  He will need to follow-up with his ENT as an\noutpatient for this.  At this point, the conversation about\npercutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement was brought up\nwith he patient and his girlfriend. [**Name (NI) **] was reluctant to have a\npercutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placed since he had\nalready experienced this in the past, however, since it was\nunsafe for him to take any food by mouth, he agreed to go ahead\nwith a temporary percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube\nplacement.  The procedure is planned for [**2101-6-20**].  For his\npneumonia, he will continue on Levofloxacin and Flagyl to\ncomplete a four week course, i.e., [**2101-7-7**].  Infectious disease\nservice was also following the patient and they will be following\nup on the serologies that are still pending.\n\n2.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - He was continued\non Flovent, Albuterol and Atrovent inhalers.\n\n3.  Eosinophilia - The patient was noted to have rising\nperipheral eosinophils up to the low 30s on [**2101-6-12**].  At around\nthat time, he also developed maculopapular rash consistent with a\ndrug reaction only on his abdomen. However, this resolved in a\nfew days.  The etiology of the eosinophils was unclear.  The\ndifferential diagnosis included a drug reaction, however, he only\nhad a rash for three to four days and it resolved while on\nLevofloxacin and Flagyl (vasculitis). Serologies have been\nnegative and he has no renal issues, a parasitic infection\n(parasite smear was negative, however, strongyloides is still\npending), fungal, coccidioides and histoplasmosis workup are\npending, HIV test was negative and a cortisol stimulation test\nwas also negative.   Infectious disease was following the patient\nand they felt that the slow response to the antibiotics and the\nhigh grade eosinophilia despite withdrawal of beta lactam\nprompted consideration of atypical pathogens, example,\nstrongyloides-related pneumonia, coccidioides (which can cause\neosinophilia and cavities), histoplasmosis or just refractory\npneumonia with superimposed eosinophilia from occult parasitic\ninfestation, example strongyloides.  They also felt that in\nconcert with the thrombocytosis that he has that this reactive\nthrombocytosis and eosinophilia may be secondary to strongyloides\nor coccidioides.  At the time of this dictation, those serologies\nare pending. Hematology/oncology was consulted because of the\neosinophilia and they felt that this was drug related since he\nhad a typical rash and history of an antibiotic reaction,\nhowever, the patient was not sure which antibiotic he had a\nreaction to in the past.  They felt that this would resolve in\ntime and there was no treatment to be implemented at this time.\n\n4.  Thrombocytosis - High platelets were noted  which continued\nto climb despite clinical improvement of the infection.  He was\nbeing treated with Aspirin, however, he did thrombose his PICC\nline on [**2101-6-14**], and had to have TPA through the line.\nHematology/oncology was consulted and they felt that the\nthrombocytosis was reactive. They felt it required no special\ntreatment though did not object to daily low dose Aspirin.\n\n5.  Elevated liver function tests - His liver function tests\nwere elevated while in the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] Intensive Care Unit.  The\netiology was not clear.  However, they trended down to normal.\nRight upper quadrant ultrasound was normal and hepatitis\nserologies were negative.\n\n6.  Electrocardiographic changes on admission - It was noted by\nthe ICU resident that these electrocardiographic changes did\nresolve quickly and they involved some T wave and nonspecific ST\nchanges. Because of this, he was started on Aspirin.   He may\nneed an outpatient cardiology workup.\n\n7.  Lines - He had a right PICC line that was placed on [**2101-6-10**].\n\n8.  Physical therapy - He was evaluated by physical therapy\nthroughout his stay and was ambulating with oxygen, however,\nwas desaturating down to the 80s on four liters of oxygen with\nambulation. Therefore, they recommend that he be discharged home\nwith home physical therapy, outpatient pulmonary physical therapy\nas well as oxygen to use at home.\n\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Fair to good.\n\nDISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient is to be discharged after\npercutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy placement on either\n[**2101-6-20**], or [**2101-6-21**].\n\nFOLLOW-UP:  He will need to follow-up with his ENT doctor to\nobtain a barium swallow as an outpatient to rule out\nesophageal mass or obstruction. He will also need follow-up\nby speech and swallow in approximately two weeks in order to\nrepeat an evaluation.  I also recommend that he follow-up\nwith his primary care physician.\n\nNutrition recommended that after his percutaneous endoscopic\ngastrostomy tube is placed he be started on bolus feedings\nwith full strength Ultracal to start on four cans per day on\nday one and then gradually advance to a goal of eight cans\nper day.\n\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  His discharge medications will be\ndictated in an addendum by the next intern who picks up this\npatient though I do know that he will be going home on\nLevofloxacin and Flagyl until [**2101-7-7**].\n\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:\n1.  Severe aspiration pneumonia complicated by hypoxic\nrespiratory failure requiring intubation for approximately\nten days.\n2.  Thrombocytosis - likely reactive.\n3.  Eosinophilia - likely a drug reaction though may be\nrelated to strongyloides or coccidioidomycosis with\nserologies pending at the time of dictation.\n4.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\n5.  Throat cancer in remission.\n\n\n\n\n                            [**Name6 (MD) **] [**Name8 (MD) **], M.D.  [**MD Number(1) 4446**]\n\nDictated By:[**Name8 (MD) 210**]\nMEDQUIST36\n\nD:  [**2101-6-19**]  11:23\nT:  [**2101-6-19**]  11:43\nJOB#:  [**Job Number 48160**]\n"}

He regained some strength on the\nhemiparetic side.  At the time of this dictation, he had\nmild-to-moderate upper motor neuron weakness in the right\nside with arm greater than leg weakness and proximal greater\nthan distal weakness.\n\nHis bleed was reevaluated with a head computed tomography\nscan which revealed a left lenticular nucleus bleed which\ninvolved the left internal capsule.  Subsequent computed\ntomography scans have shown stable bleed without evidence of\nfurther extension or ventricular involvement or mass effect.\n\nWhile in the Intensive Care Unit, he had several episodes of\ntachycardia followed by bradycardia, and Cardiology was\nconsulted.  The decision was made to place a pacemaker, which\nhe tolerated without problems.  His rhythm remained in atrial\nfibrillation with an AV paced rhythm.  He was started on\namiodarone.\n\nThe remainder of his Intensive Care Unit stay was stable and\nunremarkable, and he was transferred to the regular [**Hospital1 **]\nservice for further management.  He was found to have a left\nlower lobe infiltrate and was started on levofloxacin.  He\nalso had mild pulmonary edema, and this was treated\nsuccessfully with furosemide.\n\nGiven the risk of ischemic infarction from his atrial\nfibrillation, we have restarted his warfarin at 3 mg p.o.\nq.d.  As he is also taking amiodarone, our goal INR is\nbetween 2 and 3.\n\nAt the time of this dictation, Mr. [**Known lastname 46153**] is clinically\nstable and appropriate for emphasis on his rehabilitation.\nHe continues to have right hand weakness and inability to\nperform fine motor skills.  Therefore, he will benefit from\nOccupational Therapy as well as Physical Therapy for his\nhemiparesis.\n\nHis amiodarone schedule will be continued at 400 mg p.o.\nb.i.d. for four more days; and then 400 mg p.o. q.d. for\nthree months; and then 200 mg p.o. q.d. thereafter.\n\nCONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was improved.\n\nDISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharged to a rehabilitation facility.\n\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:\n1.  Left basoganglia bleed with internal capsule involvement.\n2.  Right hemiparesis (which is improving).\n\nSECONDARY DIAGNOSES:\n1.  Atrial fibrillation.\n2.  Hypertension.\n3.  Old ischemic stroke.\n\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:\n1.  Levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. q.d. (for six more days).\n2.  Warfarin 3 mg p.o. q.d. (check INR in two days' time for\na goal INR of 2 to 3).\n3.  Lopressor 100 mg p.o. t.i.d.\n4.  Pantoprazole 40 mg p.o. q.d.\n5.  Hydralazine 50 mg p.o. q.6h.\n6.  Enalapril 10 mg p.o. q.d.\n7.  Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.\n8.  Amiodarone 400 mg p.o. b.i.d. times four more days; and\nthen 400 mg p.o. q.d. for three months; and then 200 mg p.o.\nq.d. thereafter.\n\nDISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:\n1.  Mr. [**Known lastname 46153**] was to follow up with Cardiology here at\nthe [**Hospital1 69**].\n2.

It revealed ductal\ndilation and enhancement suggestive of cholangiocarinoma,\nwithout obvious metastasis but not amenable to resection. She\ndeveloped GI bleeding in setting of supratherapeutic PTT\nrequiring 3U PRBC transfusion and monitoring in the ICU. This\nresolved with stopping the heparin and holding her coumadin.\nPlan was initially for ERCP to look for a source of bleeding as\nwell as to stent her biliary obstruction. After family meeting\non [**5-30**] goals of care were changed to palliation and since she\nhad no further GI bleeding or pain with stable bilirubin, it was\ndecided that should would have the ERCP and stent placement in\nthe future if she developed any symptoms which can be arranged\nrequired no pain medication when in hospital but they can likely\n.\n# AF on coumadin:\nThis was rate controlled without any agents throughout\nadmission. Coumadin was held due to supratherapeutic INR and\nneed for interventions. She remained supratherapeutic with\nelevated PT and PTTs after vitamin K orally. Subcutaneous\nvitamin K was also administered.  She had the UGIB as describe\nabove so the decision was made to hold her coumadin and aspirin\nindefinitely due to risk of GI bleeding. She should continue on\nprotonix twice a day since there was no clear source of GI\nbleeding.\n.\n# Upper GI bleed:\nOne day 3 patient was noted to have melena. Her INR was 1.5 and\nPTT was in the 70s from subcutaneous heparin administration for\nDVT prevention. NG lavage revealed bright red blood and clots.\nShe was hypotensive, tachycardic and was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]\nfor further care. A right IJ TLC was placed, she was resucitated\nwith IVF and 3 units prbcs. After hematocrits were normal for 24\nhours she was sent back to the flood with a left picc line in\nplace which we will leave in place and removal can be determined\nat rehab.\n.\n# Hypotension:\nPatients blood pressure was noted to be lower 90-110s/60s after\nadmission without signs of cardiac dysfunction or infection. Her\nlisinopril was held with good effect but restarted along with\nlasix due to symptoms of volume overload.\n.\n# CAD: presumed stable\nECG with evidence of previous ischemia, patient had no pain, she\nbut asprin was stopped due to GI bleed.\n.\n# Metabolic acidosis without gap:\nDue to saline IVF, once these were stopped, bicarb levels\nimproved.\n.\n# Hyponatremia:\nInitially thought to be due to hypovolemia, then found\nconsistent with SIADH. She was placed on a free water\nrestriction 750 cc daily, sodium was monitored and increased\nappropriately. She never had evidence of mental status changes\nwith levels as low as 124.

In\naddition, there was a jailed ramus, high marginal with\nsubtotal ostial proximal narrowing.  The patient was referred\nfor evaluation by Cardiac Surgery.\n\nThe patient was taken to the Operating Room with Dr.\n[**Last Name (STitle) 70**] on [**2184-5-20**] for a CABG times three, LIMA to LAD,\nfree RIMA to OM3, sequential graft to the ramus.  Please see\nthe operative note for further details.  The patient was\ntransferred to the Intensive Care Unit in stable condition.\nThe patient was weaned and extubated from mechanical\nventilation on the first postoperative night.\n\nAfter the patient was extubated, the patient began\ncomplaining of jaw pain which had previously been his anginal\nequivalent.  Multiple EKGs were performed, none of which\nshowed any ischemic changes.  The patient was placed on a\nnitroglycerin drip without any change in the jaw pain.\n\nOn the morning of postoperative day number one, it was\ndecided to have the patient return to the catheterization\nlaboratory to evaluate his graft in light of the continued\njaw pain.  In the Cardiac Catheterization Lab, it was shown\nthat there was a lesion at the touchdown of the free RIMA\ngraft with the OM1 with a 99% occlusion.  It was decided by\nDr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**] to have the patient return to the Operating\nRoom for revision of this graft.\n\nOn postoperative day number one, the patient was taken back\nto the Operating Room for a reduced CABG times one, at which\npoint a saphenous vein graft was placed as a Y graft from the\nramus to the free RIMA.  The patient also tolerated the\nprocedure well, required dobutamine immediately\npostoperatively for maintenance of cardiac output and was\ntransferred to the Intensive Care Unit in stable condition.\nPlease see the second operative note for further details.\n\nThe patient had elevated chest tube output on postoperative\nday number one after his reoperation and required several\ntransfusions of platelets and packed red blood cells.  The\npatient remained intubated on mechanical ventilation with\nsignificant hypoxia and a chest x-ray that showed pulmonary\nedema.  The patient began aggressive diuresis in attempts to\nwean him from mechanical ventilation.  The patient was able\nto wean off the dobutamine on [**2184-5-22**] with adequate cardiac\noutput.\n\nOn postoperative day number two, the patient continued to be\nintubated on mechanical ventilation with hypoxia.  The\npatient remained sedated on propofol for his comfort and\naggressive diuresis continued.  By postoperative day number\nthree, the patient's hypoxia was improving and the amount of\nsupport that the patient was receiving from mechanical\nventilation was weaned down.  The patient was extubated from\nmechanical ventilation on postoperative day number three\nwhich he tolerated well.  The patient continued to have\naggressive diuresis.\n\nHe began ambulating with Physical Therapy on postoperative\nday number four.  On postoperative day number five, the\npatient was transferred from the Intensive Care Unit to the\nregular floor.  The patient continued to ambulate with\nPhysical Therapy.  The patient's oxygen requirement decreased\ndramatically as the patient was able to tolerate diuresis.\n\nBy postoperative day number six, the patient had completed a\nlevel V with physical therapy, was able to walk 500 feet and\nclimb one flight of stairs without difficulty.  The patient\nhad remained hemodynamically stable without any further\ncomplaints of chest or jaw pain.  The patient had been in\nstable rhythm with adequate blood pressure.  The patient's\nepicardial pacing wires had been discontinued without\ndifficulty and by postoperative day number seven, the patient\nwas cleared for discharge to home.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE:  T maximum 98, pulse 74,\nsinus rhythm, blood pressure 108/60, respiratory rate 14,\nroom air oxygen saturation 94%.

He was intubated for\nhypercarbic respiratory failure. Imaging revealed sinusitis,\ninfiltrate suspicisou for PNA vs. atelectasis and spiculated LUL\nnodule. Micro data resulted in postivie H.flu in sputum.\nTreatment was initiated with antibiotics (CTX, levoquin) for\nPNA, and steroids for COPD flare. Pt ruled in for NSTEMI,\nhowever due to hemodynamic instability, pt did not receive\ncardiac catheterization. Pt aspirated tube feeds (found in ETT)\nand PNA coverage expanded to flagyl. Respiratory status showed\nimproving acidemia, worsening hypercarbia and worsening hypoxia\nprompting a chest CT which showed left lung collapse without\nmidline shift.  A chest tube was placed urgently by CT surgery\nfor a pneumothorax and the pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].\n\n-[**Hospital1 18**] MICU COURSE ([**Date range (1) 58795**]):\n   Pt was admitted directly to MICU on dopamine where he was\nfound to be febrile to 101.2, hypotensive to SBP of 70s.  Pt was\nswithced to levophed and started on ceftazidime, vancomycin,\nlevofloxacin, and flagyl.  The patient was initially started on\nMUST protocol for presumed sepsis.  He finished his course of\nantibiotics on [**2181-2-18**], pressors were weaned off, pneumothorax\nresolved, chest tube was removed on [**2181-2-19**] and extubated\nsuccessfully on [**2181-2-18**].  The patient was placed on ASA and\nstatin for her NSTEMI, however b-blockers and ACE inhibitors\nwere held due to hypotension.  Pt also received CT demonstrating\ncolonic thickening.  Once extubated successfully and stable from\nrespiratory standpoint, the patient was transferred to the\nfloor.\n\n-[**Hospital1 18**] MICU COURSE ([**Date range (1) 58796**]):\n  Patient was found to have coffee-ground emesis/melena and\nhypotension and was therefore re-transferred to unit following\nseveral boluses of fluid to maintain perfusion pressure.  There,\npatient underwent EGD, which revealed only non-bleeding erosions\nof stomach and duodenum.  H pylori serology was negative.\nHowever, patient was found to be bacteremic with MRSA and was\ntreated with vancomycin IV 1.75g q12hours to attain a\ntherapeutic trough level.  Due to active bacteremia, patient\nalso underwent a transesophageal echocardiogram which revealed\nno evidence of endocarditis.  Following clearing of cultures and\nstabilization of blood pressure, patient was called-out to floor\nand a PICC placed.\n\n1.  Pulmonary: Pt originally seen at OSH with SOB, cough, WBC\nand found to be hypotensive, hypoxic and hypercarbic.  Pt was\nintubated at OSH for respiratory distress complicated by\npneumothorax and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for difficult\noxygenation.  At OSH, CTA neg for PE but positive for infiltrate\nsuggestive of PNA vs. atelectasis in addition to a spiculated\nlung mass in LUL.  At [**Hospital1 18**], pt finished course of abx and\npneumothorax resolved with chest tube.  Pt was successfully\nextubated, and chest tube removed without complication following\nresolution of air leak.\n\nA).  PNA:  Pt tested positive for H.Flu at OSH and received\nceftriaxone and levofloxacin.  Coverage was expanded at OSH\nafter aspiration event.  Coverage was expanded to Vancomycin,\nlevofloxacin, Flagyl and Ceftaz at [**Hospital1 18**].  BAL on [**2181-2-7**]\npositive for MRSA.  Pt finished 14 day course of antibiotics and\nhad minimal sputum following completion of course.\n\nB).  Hypoxic/Hypercarbic respiratory failure.  This was felt to\nbe secondary to H flu pneumonia as above.  Pt was transferred to\n[**Hospital1 18**] intubated.  He was successfully extubated on [**2181-2-18**],\nwithout further complications.\n\nC).  COPD: Given patient's emphysematous bullae on radiographic\nstudies, it was felt that pneumothorax was most likely secondary\nto positive pressure ventilation in the presence of chronic\nemphysema.  Patient was managed with stress dose steroids and\nnebs as needed without acute issues, and had no evidence of\nrespiratory distress resulting from obstructive physiology.\n\nD).  PTX: Patient had chest tube placed at outside hospital with\nsuccessful reduction in size of pneumothorax from 75%-20% of\nlung and did not have any evidence of tension pneumothorax\ndespite question of difficulty oxygenating.  Over the course of\nhospitalization, left apical pneumothorax continued to improve\nsignificantly.  Nonetheless, patient had persistent air leak\nthrough hospital day 9.  On hospital day 11, however, patient\nunderwent a water seal trial with continued resolution of\npneumothorax.  Therefore, on hospital day 13, patient had chest\ntube removed successfully.  However, it was noted at the time of\nremoval that patient still had persistent leak of air from\nthoracic cavity from the chest tube site, and sutures were\nplaced at the chest tube site to aid in closure.\n\nE).

She had an uncomplicated antenatal course until\nspontaneous onset of preterm labor on the day of delivery.\nThe mother received one dose of betamethasone.  Tocolysis\nwith magnesium sulfate was unsuccessful, and she progressed\nto cesarean section under epidural and spinal anesthesia for\nprogressive cervical dilatation.  Rupture of membranes\noccurred at delivery yielding clear amniotic fluid.  There\nwas no intrapartum antibiotics.  This triplet number one\nemerged with fair tone and apnea, initially heart rate less\nthan 100.  He was orally and nasally bulb suctioned, dried,\nand received bag mask ventilation.  Infant was intubated with\n3.0 endotracheal tube.  Apgars were 3 at 1 minute and 7 at 5\nminutes.

He weaned slowly over the first four days of\nlife when he was extubated.  Of note on his initial chest x-\nray, a pneumomediastinum was noted which gradually resolved\nover the subsequent 2-3 days.\n\n[**Known lastname **] required continuous positive airway pressure after\nbeing extubated from the ventilator.  He remained on\ncontinuous positive airway pressure through day of life\nnumber 14 when he was transitioned to room air.  At the time\nof transfer, he is breathing comfortably 30-40 times per\nminute in room air with oxygen saturations greater than 93\npercent.  [**Known lastname **] has also required treatment for apnea of\nprematurity with caffeine.

Single-vessel coronary artery disease.\n2. Mild in-stent restenosis of proximal LAD.\n3. Patent RCA stents.\n4. Acute anterior myocardial infarction.\n5. Cardiogenic shock.\n6. Successful primary PCI of mid-LAD.\nCOMMENTS:\n1. Selective coronary angiography demonstrated a right-dominant\ncirculation with single-vessel coronary artery disease. LMCA had\nmild\ndisease. LAD had a 60% mid-vessel in-stent restenosis, followed\nby a\ntotal occlusion between the stents in mid- and distal vessel.\nThere\nwere right-to-left collaterals supplying distal LAD. D1 had an\n80%\nstenosis. LCx had moderate diffuse disease, but no\nangiographically-apparent flow-limiting stenoses. RCA had mild\ndiffuse\ndisease, with widely patent prior stents.  2. Left\nventriculography was deferred because of tenuous hemodynamic\nstatus.  3. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated moderate pulmonary\nhypertension and cardiogenic shock. Mean RAP was 16 mmHg, mean\nPAP 39 mmHg, mean PCWP 36 mmHg. Cardiac index was markedly\nreduced at 1.5 L/min/m2. 4. Tachycardia up to 155 bpm persisted\nthroughout the case. Temporary pacemaker was successfully placed\nto the RV apex, and synchronized cardioversion at 200J was\nperformed because the rhythm was felt to be atrial flutter at\nthat time, without significant change in rate or QRS morphology.\nTemporary pacemaker was then removed.\n5. After successful PCI on the LAD, placement of the IABP,\ninitiation\nof IV milrinone, and infusion of IV furosemide, PA oxygen\nsaturation\nimproved from 38% to 52%, and PA systolic pressures decreased\nfrom 60\nmmHg to 40 mmHg.  6. Successful PTCA/stenting of the mid LAD\nwith a 2.5x28mm Hepacoat (distal) and a 3.0x18mm Hepacoat\n(proximal) stent. Final angiography revelaled no dissection, no\nresidual stenosis and TIMI-3 flow (see PTCA comments).\n.\nCARD CATH [**2133-8-26**]\n1. Selective coronary arteriography of this right dominant\nsystem revealed angiographic evidence of one vessel coronary\nartery disease. The LMCA had mild luminal irregularities. The\nLAD had luminal irregularities and diffuse disease with a 70% D1\nand 70% D2 ostial stenosis. The CFX had moderate diffuse\ndisease. The RCA had patent previously placed stents with mild\nluminal irregularites. 2. Successful PTCA of the D1 and D2 with\na 2.25x15mm cutting balloon and a 2.5x15mm sprinter balloon\nrespectively. Final angiography revealed 20% D1 and 30% D2\nresidual stenosis, no dissection and TIMI-3 flow (see PTCA\ncomments).  FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  1. One vessel coronary artery\ndisease. 2. PTCA of D1 and D2.\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nRESPIRATORY FAILURE:  presented w/ marked hypoxia 80% on RA in\nthe setting of CXR showing bilateral infiltrates.  Given\nsuspicion for pneumonia, levofloxacin and azithromycin were\nstarted.  Pt was intubated for hypoxia.  Mechanical ventilation\nwas not required post-2nd cardiac cath (see next section).  Pt\ncontinued to spike fevers and coverage was broadened to include\nZosyn and vancomycin, with the completion of seven days of the\nformer.\n.\nCARDIAC ISCHEMIA w/ HYPOTENSION:  Given slight elevation in\ncardiac enzymes and known CAD, Pt was started on heparin gtt on\nadmission.  Aspirin, plavix, beta blocker were continued.  TTE\non [**2133-8-19**] showed moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis.\nSevere posterior hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic\nfunction is moderately depressed.  On [**8-20**] Pt ECG showed ST\nsegment elevation in leads V3-V5 w/ hypotension.  Pt was taken\nfor cardiac catheterization that showed single-vessel coronary\nartery disease (primary PCI to mid-LAD), a mild in-stent\nrestenosis of proximal LAD and patent RCA stents, and findings\nconsistent with cardiogenic shock requiring an intra-aortic\nbaloon pump, in addition to dobutamine and levophed.  IABP was\ndiscontinued after two days and levophed was discontiued after\nthree days.  Pt had failure to wean from the ventilator\nsecondary to recurrent ischemia and a second cardiac\ncatheterization was performed on [**2133-8-26**] at which time PTCA of\nD1 and D2 were performed.  Pt did not require mechanical\nventilation shortly post-cath.  Pt was diuresed w/ lasix to dry\nweight.  Nitrates were continued for anginal pain.  Acei was\nadded back.\n.\nATRIAL FIBRILLATION:  ryhthm after PCI.  started on amiodarone\nand ryhthm reverted back to normal sinus\n.\nRENAL INSUFFICIENCY:  Cr bumped from baseline of 1.4 to 1.9 on\nfirst day of admission, thought to be pre-renal in etiology.\nSpironolactone and acei were held.  Cr improved with hydration.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nglyburide\nglucophage\nlipitor\nhumalin\ntoprol\nnorvasc\nlasix\nlisinopril\nASA,plavix\naldactone\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.

{"TEXT":"Admission Date:  [**2128-10-29**]       Discharge Date:  [**2128-11-10**]\n\nDate of Birth:   [**2070-9-2**]       Sex:  M\n\nService:  Bloomgart\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 50-year-old\nmale transferred from [**Hospital 86**] Hospital with no known past\nmedical history.  He was found unconscious at home by his\nbrother on [**2128-10-20**].  The patient had last been seen\ntwo days prior to this and was well at that time.\n\nIn the Emergency Room at [**Hospital 86**] Hospital, the patient had a\ntemperature of 95.2 rectally, blood pressure was 119/90,\npulse was 84, respiratory rate was 26, oxygen saturation was\n96% on 100% nonrebreather.  The patient received 2 liters of\nnormal saline and was intubated for airway protection.\nArterial blood gas on 100% FIO2 ventilator showed a pH of\n7.43, PCO2 of 21, PO2 of 342.\n\nLaboratory values sent on presentation revealed sodium was\n142, glucose was 110, calcium was 6.3, white blood cell count\nwas 14, albumin was 2.1.  Creatine phosphokinase was 746 with\na troponin of less than 0.3.  Serum and urine toxicology\nscreens were negative.  INR was 1.8.\n\nThe patient required no sedation while on the ventilator.  A\nhead CT was obtained which showed a large 2-cm intercellular\nmass consistent with a pituitary macroadenoma.  A chest x-ray\nshowed no acute abnormalities.\n\nAt [**Hospital 86**] Hospital, the patient was admitted directly to the\nIntensive Care Unit where he initially required pressor\nsupport with dopamine.  The patient was hydrated and given\nstress-dose steroids with hydrocortisone given pituitary\nmacroadenoma seen on head CT.  Of note, the patient did not\nrequire any sedation while intubated.  The patient was\nextubated 48 hours later without incident.\n\nThe patient's hematocrit on admission was 31 which decreased\nto 25 while on hydration.  The patient was transfused with\npacked red blood cells.  The patient subsequently sent out\ncoffee-grounds emesis from a nasogastric tube with\nmaroon-colored stools.  An esophagogastroduodenoscopy was\nperformed which revealed mild distal esophagitis as well as a\nmoderate-sized hiatal hernia.  In the first portion of\nduodenum there was noted to be a large ulcer with a clean\nwhite base with no stigmata of recent bleeding.  The patient\nwas started on intravenous Protonix and a Helicobacter pylori\nantibody was sent which returned negative.  Serial\nhematocrits remained stable over the next several days.\n\nGiven the large pituitary macroadenoma seen on head CT and\nhypothermia and hypotension on presentation, a workup for\npanhypopituitarism was initiated.  The patient's initial\nsodium was 142 with a potassium of 3.1.  Total T3 was 44\n(normal 45 to 137).  Free T4 was 0.8 (normal 0.8 to 1.5).\nFollicle-stimulating hormone was 7 (normal 1.1 to 8).  LH was\n1.35 (normal 2 to 12).  Periactin level was 1.86 (normal 1.61\nto 18.7).  Initial cortisol level drawn prior to the\nadministration of hydrocortisone was 11 (normal range 3 to\n17).  Given low-normal free T4 and total T3 and relative\nhypotension the patient was started on intravenous\nlevothyroxine and hydrocortisone.\n\nThe patient underwent a follow-up magnetic resonance\nimaging/magnetic resonance angiography approximately six days\nfollowing presentation.  Magnetic resonance imaging revealed\na 5-cm X 2-cm X 2.5-cm enhancing lobulated soft tissue mass\noriginating in the sella turcica and extending superiorly\ninto the supracellular cistern; most likely representing a\npituitary macroadenoma.  There was no evidence of hemorrhage\nor infarct on diffusion-weighted images.  A magnetic\nresonance angiography of the surface of [**Location (un) 431**] and posterior\ncirculation was normal.\n\nFollowing extubation, the patient was noted to be hypoxic on\na shovel mask.  A CT of the chest with CT spiral angiography\nwas obtained which showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism.\nThere were small bilateral lobe airspace infiltrates;\notherwise, lung parenchyma was clear.  The patient was\nstarted on ceftazidime and Flagyl for a presumed aspiration\npneumonia.  Given liver function abnormalities on\npresentation, and abdominal CT was done which showed evidence\nof cirrhosis with a small amount of ascites.  Given liver\nabnormalities and hypoxia, a concern for hepatopulmonary\nsyndrome was considered.\n\nA workup of cirrhosis was initiated at the outside hospital.\nHepatitis A, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C panels were\nnegative.  Ceruloplasmin level was normal.  Alpha-fetoprotein\nwas negative.\n\nThe patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for evaluation by Neurosurgery following medical\nstabilization.\n\nThe patient's brother was [**Name (NI) 653**] and revealed that the\npatient had been feeling unwell for several years prior to\nadmission.  The patient's brother reports the patient\nappeared jaundiced and had progressive fatigue and decreased\nenergy levels.  The patient had not seen a physician prior to\npresentation at the outside hospital.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  None; per report from brother the\npatient had not seen a physician prior to presentation to the\noutside hospital.\n\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  None.\n\nALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is single.  He has never been\nmarried with no children.  The patient lived with his mother\nuntil approximately one year ago when she passed away.  He\ndenied any history of alcohol use, tobacco use, or\nintravenous drug use.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON TRANSFER:  Temperature was 97.2,\nblood pressure was 98/60, pulse was 74, respiratory rate was\n20, oxygen saturation was 93% on 70% scoop mask.  In general,\na very pale and chronically ill-appearing male.  No secondary\nsexual characteristics.  Largely unresponsive and nonverbal.\nHe followed simple commands; would nod \"yes\" or \"no\" to\nquestions.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination\nrevealed pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light.\nMucous membranes were dry with crusted blood in his mouth.\nPoor dentition.  Cardiovascular examination revealed a\nregular rate, normal first heart sound and second heart\nsound.  No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Lungs revealed\ncrackles at the bases, right greater than left.  No stridor.\nAbdomen was soft and nontender.  Positive distention with\nfluid wave.  Extremities were diffusely edematous, pitting.\nClotting noted on hands.  Neurologically, as above unable to\nassess cranial nerves as the patient could not follow finger\ndirections properly.\n\nPERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories\nobtained during this admission.\n\n1.  ENDOCRINE:  Prolactin was 9.6 (normal 2 to 20).\nCortisone stimulation test (no prednisone given 24 hours\nprior to test) was 22, 27, and 23.  Aldosterone was 90, 103,\n103.  Adrenocorticotropic hormone was pending.\nFollicle-stimulating hormone was 1.7 (normal 2 to 10).  LH\nwas 1.4 (normal 2 to 10).  Thyroid-stimulating hormone was\nless than 0.05.  Free testosterone was less than 0.05.\nTestosterone was 19 (normal 270 to 1100).  Growth hormone and\ninsulin-like growth factor levels were pending at the time of\nthis dictation.\n\n2.  LIVER STUDIES:  Hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C\nserologies were negative.  AST was 38, ALT was 33, alkaline\nphosphatase was 61, total bilirubin was 1.5, amylase was 43,\nlipase was 36, Helicobacter pylori negative.  Albumin was\n1.8.  INR was 1.8.  Antimitochondrial antibody was negative.\nAnti-smooth muscle antibody positive.  Antinuclear antibody\npositive.  Alpha-fetoprotein was 2.6.  IgG was normal.  Iron\nlevel was 14.  Ferritin was 22.  Total iron-binding capacity\nwas 202.\n\n3.  HEMATOLOGY:  Platelets were 113.  Fibrinogen was 97.  SBP\nwas 10 to 40.  D-dimer was 500 to 1000.  LDH was 390.\nReticulocyte count was 4.6.  Ammonia was 41.  Human\nimmunodeficiency virus negative.\n\n4.  MICROBIOLOGY:\n(a)  Urine on admission with no white blood cells.\n(b)  Blood cultures 1/4 bottles from [**2128-10-30**] drawn\nfrom subclavian central line were positive for Staphylococcus\naureus coagulase-positive oxacillin resistant. Follow-up\nblood cultures on [**11-1**], [**11-3**], and [**11-4**]\nshowed no growth to date.\n(c)  Peritoneal fluid on [**2128-11-1**] revealed no\ngrowth.\n(d)  Pleural fluid from [**11-4**] revealed no growth.\n(e)  Sputum culture from [**2128-11-3**] with moderate\ngrowth of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.\n(f)  Blood cultures for fungal and acid-fast bacillus with no\nfungus or macrobacteria isolated.  Stool for Clostridium\ndifficile negative on [**11-1**] and [**11-4**].\n\nRADIOGRAPHIC IMAGING:\n1.  A portable chest x-ray on [**2128-10-29**] revealed low\nlung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis, left greater than\nright.\n2.  A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis on [**2128-10-31**]\nshowed a large amount of abdominal pelvic ascites as well as\nsignificant soft tissue edema, bilateral pleural effusions.\nThe liver was small without focal masses.  Pancreas, spleen,\nadrenal glands, and kidneys were unremarkable.  The main\nportal and splenic vein was patent.\n3.  A chest CT on [**2128-10-31**] with contrast revealed no\nenlarged lymph nodes and small pleural effusions (left\ngreater than right).  No focal lung consolidations,\npneumothorax, or nodule.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:\n\n1.  HYPOXIA:  The patient presented with oxygen saturations\nof 93% to 97% on 100% nonrebreather.  An arterial blood gas\nwas obtained on admission which showed pH was 7.45, PCO2 was\n33, PAO2 was 80, with A:A gradient of over 300.\n\nA review of the chest CT obtained at the outside hospital\nrevealed small bilateral pleural effusions with otherwise\nclear lung parenchyma.  No evidence of pneumonia.  In\naddition, a CT angiogram obtained at the outside hospital\nshowed no evidence of pulmonary embolism.\n\nA Pulmonary consultation was obtained.  Given cirrhosis seen\non abdominal CT, concern for hepatopulmonary syndrome was\naddressed.  A echocardiogram with bubble study was obtained\nwhich indicated a marked right-to-left shunt strongly\nsuggestive of pulmonary arterial venous shunting.\n\nA CT of the chest with contrast was repeated; and on review\nwith Radiology, there was no large pulmonary arteriovenous\nmalformation which would be amenable to embolization.\n\nDuring his hospital course, the patient's oxygen saturations\ncontinued to decline.  A repeat arterial blood gas on\n[**11-2**] showed pH was 7.51/26/53 on 100% nonrebreather.\nThe patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for\nfurther management.  The etiology of hypoxia was again\nthought to be secondary to hepatopulmonary syndrome.\n\nThe patient underwent a right-sided therapeutic thoracentesis\non [**11-4**] with removal of 1400 cc of clear serous fluid.\nThe pleural fluid was transudative with 11 white blood cells\nand [**Pager number **] red blood cells.  Fluid culture showed no growth.\nThe etiology of fluid was thought to be from massive ascites.\nFollowing thoracentesis, the patient's oxygenation did not\nimprove.\n\nThe patient was evaluated by the Liver Service for a possible\nliver transplant, but was not a candidate secondary to\nprofound hypoxia.  Therefore, treatment for hepatopulmonary\nsyndrome remained supportive with supplemental oxygen.\n\n2.  SUPPRESSED MENTAL STATUS:  On admission, the patient\nresponded mainly to commands but remained largely\nunresponsive.  A CT scan done on admission at the outside\nhospital showed a large pituitary macroadenoma.  A follow-up\nmagnetic resonance imaging/magnetic resonance angiography did\nnot show any evidence of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke.  PA\nCO2 on arrival to the floor was 31 on arterial blood gas.\n\nA Neurology consultation was obtained.  The patient underwent\nelectroencephalogram which showed slow background maximum\nfrequency 6 hertz versus delta frequency consistent with\nencephalopathy.\n\nThe etiology of suppressed mental status was thought to be\nsecondary to structural lesion (pituitary mass versus toxic\nmetabolic state), hepatopulmonary syndrome.  On discharge,\nthe patient was able to answer simple questions and nod \"yes\"\nand \"no.\"\n\n3.  ENDOCRINE SYSTEM:  The patient presented with known\npituitary macroadenoma with suppressed thyroid-stimulating\nhormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, LH, and normal\ncortisol.  The Endocrinology Service was consulted.  The\npatient was initially started on stress-dose hydrocortisone\nwhich was tapered to 30 mg intravenously q.a.m. and 15 mg\nintravenously q.p.m.  In addition, he was started on\nlevothyroxine 100 mcg p.o. q.d.\n\nGiven the relative hypoxia and poor medical condition, the\npatient was unstable to go to the operating room for surgical\nresection of the pituitary mass.\n\n4.  HEMATOLOGY:  The patient presented with a platelet count\nof 113.  Given the use of subcutaneous heparin for deep\nvenous thrombosis prophylaxis at the outside hospital a\nhemagglutination-inhibition test antibody was sent and was\npositive.  In addition, a disseminated intravascular\ncoagulation panel was sent on hospital day two, which\nrevealed a platelet count of 80, INR was 1.8, fibrinogen was\n102, D-dimer was 500 to 1000, and SBP of 52, 110.\n\nA Hematology consultation was placed.  It was unclear if\ncoagulation abnormalities were secondary to liver disease\nversus disseminated intravascular coagulation.  The patient\nwas supported with cryo to maintain fibrinogen greater than\n100, and fresh frozen plasma was given prior to procedures.\n\nThe etiology of disseminated intravascular coagulation\nincluded sepsis.  Blood cultures drawn on admission grew\nmethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in [**12-26**] bottles.\nThe patient's central line was removed, and the patient was\nstarted on vancomycin.  However, heparin products were\navoided.  The patient continued to have low platelets,\nelevated INR, and low fibrinogen which was thought to be\nlikely secondary to progressive liver disease.\n\n5.  GASTROINTESTINAL SYSTEM:  The patient presented with\nevidence of cirrhosis with an elevated INR, large ascites, an\nalbumin of 2.1, and a bilirubin of 1.2.\n\nThe patient's family denied any history of alcohol use, and\ntoxicology screen on admission was negative.  Hepatitis A,\nhepatitis B, and hepatitis C panels were negative.\nCeruloplasmin and iron levels were both normal.  Liver\nfunction tests on admission were within normal limits.  In\naddition, an antinuclear antibody and anti-smooth muscle\nantibody returned positive; consistent with possible\nautoimmune hepatitis.\n\nThe patient underwent a diagnostic paracentesis to rule out\nspontaneous bacterial peritonitis in the setting of\ndisseminated intravascular coagulation of unknown etiology.\nThis revealed 10 white blood cells with [**Pager number 45264**] red blood cells;\nand the culture showed no growth.  Fluid was transudative.\nAscites albumin level was less than 1.\n\nThe Liver Service and Gastrointestinal Service were consulted\nregarding the management of a new diagnosis of cirrhosis.\nThe Gastrointestinal Service indicated no role for steroids.\nIn addition, the Liver Service evaluated the patient for a\npossible liver transplant; but given pronoun hypoxia, the\npatient was not a candidate.\n\nAt the outside hospital the patient had an upper\ngastrointestinal bleed with coffee-grounds emesis and maroon\nstools.  Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed a duodenal\nulcer.  A Helicobacter pylori was sent and was negative.  The\npatient was kept on Protonix 40 mg intravenously b.i.d.   On\n[**2128-11-8**] the patient had bright red blood per rectum\nwith a drop in his hematocrit from 27.2 to 21.6.  The patient\nwas transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells.  Per\ndiscussions with family, management was to be supportive care\nonly.\n\n6.  FAMILY DISCUSSION:  Given large pituitary macroadenoma,\nprogressive hypoxia secondary to hepatopulmonary syndrome,\nwith no available medical therapy, a family discussion was\nheld with the patient's brother and friend.\n\nGiven progressive medical illnesses, it was decided that the\npatient would be do not resuscitate/do not intubate and\nsupportive care only.  At discharge, the patient was\ntransferred to nursing home with hospice care.\n\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:\n1.  Pituitary macroadenoma.\n2.  Cirrhosis likely secondary to autoimmune hepatitis.\n3.  Hepatopulmonary syndrome.\n4.  Upper gastrointestinal bleed secondary to peptic ulcer\ndisease.\n5.  Disseminated intravascular coagulation.\n\n\n\n\n\n                            [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 734**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 735**], M.D.  [**MD Number(1) 736**]\n\nDictated By:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1297**]\nMEDQUIST36\n\nD:  [**2128-11-9**]  16:11\nT:  [**2128-11-9**]  16:33\nJOB#:  [**Job Number 19281**]\n"}

[**Known lastname 48250**]\nwas delivered by cesarean section, given progressive cervical\ndilatation in the setting of premature rupture of membranes\nand footling breech.  Delivery was uncomplicated and she\nemerged with a spontaneous cry.  Her Apgar scores were 7 at\none minute and 8 at five minutes.  She was subsequently\nadmitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit for further\nmanagement of prematurity.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:  1. Cardiovascular:  [**Known lastname 48250**]\nremained cardiovascularly stable during this interim period.\nAn intermittent murmur was observed on day of life 61, which\nwas likely a flow murmur.  No cardiac work-up was done at\nthis point.\n\n2. Respiratory:  [**Known lastname 48250**] was initially intubated in the\nDelivery Room and responded well to two doses of surfactant\nand weaned to nasal CPAP.  On day of life 11 she was\nreintubated for increased work of breathing.  She\nsubsequently developed moderate cloudy secretion via her\nendotracheal tube and a tracheal aspirate sent on day of life\n15 had revealed Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative rods,\nat which time she was treated for presumed tracheitis.\nHowever her respiratory status continued to worsen requiring\nincreased ventilatory support.  On day of life 20, given\nprogressively worsening work of breathing and CO2 retention\ndespite escalating ventilatory support, she was switched from\nconventional ventilation to high-frequency oscillating\nventilation, as well as starting on Combivent for possible\nbronchospastic component to her respiratory distress.  A\nrepeat tracheal aspirate sent on day of life 21 had\nsubsequently grown Klebsiella, E. coli and Pseudomonas.  She\nremained on high-frequency oscillator until day of life 30,\nwhen she self-extubated and she did well on nasal CPAP of 6.\nCaffeine was started at that time with discontinuation of\nCombivent.  She was subsequently weaned from nasal CPAP to\nnasal cannula on day of life 36 and to room air on day of\nlife 47.  On room air she rarely had an apneic and\nbradycardic episodes while she remained on caffeine.  On day\nof life 62, she was reintubated for laser eye surgery and\nsubsequently extubated to nasal cannula on day of life 63.\nShe went back to her baseline room air on day of life 65 and\ncaffeine was discontinued on day of life 67 given minimal\napnea of prematurity, and she has been stable on room air for\nthe four days prior to this dictation.\n\n3. Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  [**Known lastname 48250**] continued to\nadvance on calories and was on 30 calories with ProMod on day\nof life 20, when she developed severe respiratory distress\nrequiring switching from conventional ventilation to\nhigh-frequency oscillator ventilation.  She was made n.p.o.\nat that time until day of life 30, when she was restarted on\nenteral feeds and tolerated gradual advancement.  She was\nbriefly made n.p.o. around the time of her laser surgery and\nsubsequently resumed enteral feeds without any difficulties.\nShe is currently on total fluids 150 cc per kg per day,\ntaking breast milk 32 with ProMod p.o. p.g. with occasional\nbreast-feeding.  She has been gaining weight well.  Her birth\nweight was 695 grams.  Her weight on the day of this\ndictation is 1,800 grams.  She has been stooling well,\nrequiring occasional glycerin suppositories.\n\n4. GI:  [**Known lastname 48250**] was started on phototherapy for initial\nbilirubin level of 3.6.  She continued phototherapy until day\nof life 11 at which time phototherapy was discontinued and a\nrecheck of bilirubin on day of life 12 was 1.7.\n\n5. Infectious disease:  [**Known lastname 48250**] completed an initial 48-hour\nrule out sepsis course of ampicillin and gentamicin.  On day\nof life 11, given increased respiratory distress, another\nblood culture was obtained which remained no growth to date.\nShe completed 48 hours of antibiotic treatment with\nvancomycin and gentamicin.  On day of life 15 she developed\nworsening respiratory distress despite ventilatory support\nand a tracheal aspirate at that time grew Staphylococcus\naureus and Gram-negative rods.  She was started on vancomycin\nand gentamicin which subsequently was switched to oxacillin\nand gentamicin based on sensitivity panel.  Blood culture\nobtained on [**2143-6-7**] was negative.  Approximately five days\ninto her antibiotics course, [**Known lastname 48250**] developed significant\nrespiratory distress with CO2 retention.  A repeat tracheal\naspirate was sent that grew Klebsiella, E. coli and\nPseudomonas.  Blood culture obtained at that time was\nnegative.  Her antibiotic regimen was switched from oxacillin\nand gentamicin to vancomycin as well as adding ceftazidime.\nOn [**2143-6-27**] the antibiotic regimen was modified based on the\nsensitivity panel, and she remained on ceftazidime and\ngentamicin for the remaining 14-day course that she completed\non day of life 29.  A repeat blood culture on [**2143-6-14**] was\nnegative.  [**Known lastname 48250**] has since then remained off antibiotics and\nhas had no further infectious issues.  A lumbar puncture\nobtained toward the end of the 14-day course for presumed\npneumonia/sepsis, was benign with 6 white blood cells and 24\nred blood cells.\n\n6. Neurological:  [**Known lastname 48250**] had a negative head ultrasound on\nday of life three, as well as day of life 10.  A follow-up\nhead ultrasound on day of life 30 was also negative and she\nshould have another follow-up head ultrasound prior to the\ndischarge from the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit.\n\n7. Hematology:  [**Known lastname 48251**] initial hematocrit was 44.5.  She is\ntype B+, Coombs' negative.  On day of life 16 she was\ntransfused with 20 cc per kg of packed red blood cells for an\nhematocrit of 26.7.  After obtaining physician consent, she\nwas transfused again on day of life 21 for an hematocrit of\n32.9.  A follow-up post transfusion hematocrit was 41.2 on\nday of life 23.  She has not had any blood transfusions since\nthen and her last hematocrit was on day of life 54 with an\nhematocrit of 30.4 and a reticulocyte count of 9.1.\n\n8. Sensory:  A. Audiology - hearing screen has not been\nperformed during this interim period.  She will require a\nhearing screen prior to discharge.\n\nB. Ophthalmology - [**Known lastname 48250**] had her initial ophthalmologic\nexamination on day of life 42 that revealed a mature retina\nin zone 2.  A follow-up examination on day of life 57 showed\nthat her eyes had progressed to stage 2 with plus disease in\nzone 2 which subsequently progressed to prethreshold in zone\n1.  She had laser eye surgery on [**2143-7-23**] and a follow-up eye\nexamination on day of life 69 had shown good reaction to the\nlaser treatment with resolving plus disease.  However due to\npoor viewing of the retina, retinopathy of prematurity was\nunable to be staged at this time.  She is to have a follow-up\neye examination on [**2143-8-7**].  She currently remains on\natropine.\n\nPRIMARY PEDIATRICIAN:  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].\n\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:\n1. Vitamin E.\n2. Iron.\n3.

The morning of admission he was found by his wife\nunresponsive.  [**Name2 (NI) **] was then awoke but had another questionable\nunresponsive episode when he was found by emergency medical\nservices.  At the outside hospital he was initially stable.\nAn electrocardiogram showed nonspecific ST changes.  He had\nsome neurologic changes, questionable for seizure.\nTherefore, he was sent for a head computerized tomography\nscan.  While at head computerized tomography scan, he coded.\nHe was in a bradycardiac arrest.  He was given Atropine and\nfound to be in complete heart block.  He was revived with the\nuse of external pacers.  At that point he was revived but\nintubated secondary to congestive heart failure.\nSubsequently he was noted to have a non-Q wave myocardial\ninfarction with a peak troponin of 4.9, creatinine kinase\n867.  Thereafter he was maintained on Lasix, Nitroglycerin\ndrip in the Intensive Care Unit.  He had a cardiac\ncatheterization on [**12-17**] showing three vessel disease\nwith proximal lesions of the left anterior descending, left\ncircumflex and right coronary artery with a global\nhypokinesis with an ejection fraction of approximately 30%.\nThe patient was the maintained on Lasix, Nitroglycerin drip\nand heparin and transferred to the [**Hospital6 649**] for a coronary artery bypass graft.  Prior to\nthe coronary artery bypass graft the patient also developed a\nfever which was thought to be due to a urinary tract\ninfection as well as a pneumonia and urine growing greater\nthan 100,000 Escherichia coli.  Chest x-ray showed a right\nmiddle lobe infiltrate.  He was initially started on Unasyn\nand Vancomycin and kept on Unasyn 3 gm q. 8 hours for six\ndays prior to transfer to [**Hospital6 2018**].  At [**Hospital6 256**] the patient\npresented with a low-grade fever, still slight leukocytosis\nand hypoxia to 83% on room air, improving to 96% on 4 liters.\nHe was thus transferred to Medicine for treatment of\npneumonia urinary tract infection, congestive heart failure\nand acute renal failure prior to coronary artery bypass\ngraft.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Diabetes mellitus; 2.  Question of\ncoronary artery disease; 3.  Microscopic hematuria,\npreviously unworked up; 4.  Anemia; 5.  Urinary tract\ninfection; 6.  Pneumonia; 7.  Chronic renal insufficiency\nwith acute renal insufficiency.\n\nALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.\n\nMEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER TO MEDICINE SERVICE:  Ambien 5\nq.h.s., Levaquin 500 q.d., Heparin drip, Nitroglycerin drip,\nInsulin sliding scale, Lasix 40 b.i.d., Metoprolol 25 q.i.d.,\nPravastatin 40 q.d. and Aspirin 160 two p.o. q.d.  At home it\nwas reported the patient was on Amaryl 2 mg q.d., Carvedilol\nand Lipitor.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives at home with his wife.  [**Name (NI) **]\nquit smoking tobacco 25 years ago.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  His family history is non-contributory.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs on transfer to Medicine\nService were 99.6 temperature maximum, temperature currently\nwas 98.2, blood pressure 104 to 120/60 to 70, and last at\n110/60, heartrate ranging 65 to 76, respiratory rate 20,\noxygen saturations 96% on 4 liters.  Ins and outs of\n[**Telephone/Fax (1) 52732**].  On examination this is a well-appearing although\nslightly pale elderly male in no acute distress.  There was\nno jugulovenous distension visible.  His heart was regular\nrate and rhythm without any evidence of murmurs, rubs or\ngallops.  He had dry rales bilaterally, right greater than\nleft, approximately half way up on the right and one-third of\nthe way up the lung on the left side.  There was minimal\nlower extremity edema noted.  The patient had a nasal cannula\nin place.  His abdomen was soft, no tenderness to palpation.\nHis pulses were equal bilaterally.\n\nLABORATORY DATA:  On laboratory data significant was a white\nblood cell count of 12.3.  Chemistry panel was notable for a\nBUN of 42 and a creatinine of 2.4.  The patient's baseline\ncreatinine was approximately 1.1, on transfer was 24 for BUN\nand 1.8 for creatinine.  His urinalysis was negative for any\nevidence of urinary tract infection.  Liver function tests\nhad a slight increase of ALT to 105 and AST at 61.  His\ncreatinine kinase was 53, his troponin T was 4.47.  Chest\nx-ray was done which showed evidence of congestive heart\nfailure with bilateral effusions and increased vascularity\nand evidence of pulmonary edema.  On a repeat urinalysis it\ndid show 21 to 50 red blood cells but negative for urinary\ntract infection and urine cultures were negative.  Blood\ncultures times two were also negative.  Sputum culture was\nnot able to be done as the patient was not producing any\nsputum.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 68 year old male with a history\nof diabetes and question of coronary artery disease presented\nto [**Hospital6 256**] status post acute\nmyocardial infarction with three vessel disease on a\ndiagnostic catheterization at an outside hospital, also\ncongestive heart failure with likely pneumonia and urinary\ntract infection, acute and chronic renal failure, awaiting\ncoronary artery bypass graft after resolution of his medical\nissues.  Per the patient's hypoxia it was deemed mostly to be\ndue to his congestive heart failure as there was no evidence\nof pneumonia at the time of his presentation to [**Hospital6 1760**].  The patient was\nsufficiently diuresed.  The hypoxia subsequently resolved and\nat the time of transfer for his coronary artery bypass graft\nthe patient had an oxygen saturation of 93 to 94% on room\nair.  For the question of pneumonia on top of this, causing\npossible hypoxia, the patient was continued on Levaquin for a\nseven day course with complete clinical resolution.\n\nAs far as his overall infectious disease issues, the patient\nhad clinical resolution of both his urinary tract infection\nand pneumonia with a seven day course of Levaquin, not\nrestarted on any other antibiotics.\n\nOverall cardiovascular issues, diuresis was continued.  The\npatient clinically euvolemic and was then discontinued to\nfollow his overall ins and outs on a day by day basis.  His\ncongestive heart failure did improve clinically throughout\nhis hospital stay prior to his coronary artery bypass graft.\n\nFor his coronary artery disease, the patient was kept on\nMetoprolol and Nitroglycerin drip, heparin drip and statins,\nand awaiting coronary artery bypass graft for bypass of the\ncoronary artery lesion.\n\nFor his acute and chronic renal insufficiency, renal\nconsultation was obtained.  Their feeling was that this was\nlikely acute tubular necrosis with possible also\nglomerulonephritis.  The acute tubular necrosis was resolving\nwith stabilized creatinine of approximately 2.3.  As far as\nthe glomerulonephritis portion of it, the feeling was that it\nwas due to either diabetic or IgA nephritis.  His IgA level\nwas increased.  For continued workup of this Renal Team is\nrecommending outpatient nephrology follow up for this\npatient.  In addition for his microscopic hematuria, possibly\ndue to either glomerulonephritis or some sort of lesion\nwithin the bladder or urinary tract infection for which the\npatient should also have outpatient Urology follow up.\n\nOn hospital day #7, the patient developed a temporary acute\nesophageal obstruction from a food bolus.  Gastroenterology\nconsult was obtained.  According to the patient he has had a\nprogressive two year history of dysphagia, although this is\nthe first time he ever had an acute esophageal obstruction by\nwhich he was not able to swallow his saliva nor any fluids.\nAfter approximately five or six hours the obstruction did\nresolve on its own, not requiring any intervention.\nAccording to Gastroenterology the patient should have an\noutpatient gastroenterology follow up or likely upper\nendoscopy and should continue on a proton pump inhibitor for\nlikely gastroesophageal reflux and prevention of any possible\nstrictures.\n\nOn transfer, to Cardiothoracic Surgery for the coronary\nartery bypass graft, it was the opinion of the medical team\nthat this patient will require follow ups after his\ndischarged from the hospital.\n\n1.  Nephrology for follow up of his acute and chronic renal\nfailure.\n2.  Urology for his microscopic hematuria.\n3.  Gastroenterology for his progressive dysphagia, episode\nof esophageal obstruction.\n4.  Follow up with his primary care physician for continued\ncare.\n\nOther recommendations will be left to the Cardiothoracic\nSurgery Team who will be taking care of the patient for his\ncoronary artery bypass graft.\n\n\n\n                            [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1211**], M.D.  [**MD Number(1) 1212**]\n\nDictated By:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 13389**]\nMEDQUIST36\n\nD:  [**2117-12-25**]  14:41\nT:  [**2117-12-26**]  16:06\nJOB#:  [**Job Number 52733**]\n"}

The\npatient and her daughter then took a walk.  Soon thereafter, the\ndaughter, who is pregnant, asked to sit and rest.  At that time,\nthe patient demonstrate apparent difficulty breathing.  The\ndaughter called 911.  Between the time of the call and the\narrival of EMS, the patient developed a left gaze preference and\nright hemipareis.

ET tube is 4 cm above\nthe\nlevel of the carina. A nasogastric tube tip extends to the\nstomach, however the sidehole remains above the GE junction. The\nright lateral chest wall is excluded from the radiograph. Dense\nretrocardiac opacity is noted likely due to atelectasis,\nhowever, a focal infectious process cannot be completely\nexcluded. There is marked prominence of the pulmonary\ninterstitium, likely acute pulmonary edema superimposed on\nemphysema. No sizable left pleural effusion is seen. There is no\npneumothorax.\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Satisfactory position of the endotracheal tube. NG tube needs\nadvancement by at least 8 cm.\n2. Acute pulmonary edema, likely cardiogenic in etiology.\n3. Left retrocardiac density as above. Likely atelectasis,\nhowever\npneumonia cannot be excluded.\n.\nCTA CHEST [**2125-5-28**]: There are no filling defects in the main\nsegmental pulmonary arteries to suggest bilateral pulmonary\nembolism. The evaluation of distal segmental branches,\nespecially to lower lobes is limited. Pulmonary artery remains\nsignificantly enlarged. The heart size remains enlarged. Again\nnoted is a calcified and non-calcified plaque in the aorta. Some\nof the noncalcified plaque is ulcerated. There is no pericardial\nor pleural effusion. Coronary calcification involves LAD, RCA,\nand circumflex. Diffuse bilateral septal thickening has\ndeveloped in the interval, when compared to the prior study.\nThere is severe extensive emphysema, involving the entire lungs,\nmore pronounced in the upper lobes, right greater than left.\nThe airways are patent to the segmental levels bilaterally.\nLimited\nevaluation of upper abdominal organs is unremarkable. The\npatient is post right mastectomy. Several mediastinal lymph\nnodes are present, measuring up to 14 mm in the prevascular and\nlower paratracheal\nstation. There is a left hilar node, measuring 13 mm in short\naxis diameter. Enlarged right hilar nodes are also present.\nBONE WINDOWS: Demonstrate no concerning lytic or sclerotic\nlesions. The compression fracture of T8 vertebral body is\nunchanged in extent. Extensive degenerative changes of the right\nglenohumeral joints are again noted.\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Interval development of diffuse bilateral septal thickening,\nmost likely secondary to cardiogenic edema, given acute\npresentation. However, in a patient with apparent history of\nbreast carcinoma (not provided but surmised from images), septal\nthickening may also be due to lymphangitic tumor spread.\n2.

In addition she had a bronchoalveolar lavage\nthat showed no white cells, no RBCs and 8% EOS.  The patient's\nrespiratory status improved and she was extubated; she was back\non her baseline oxygen requirement and saturation upon\ndischarge.  Her respiratory culture was positive for MRSA.\nHowever as the patient demonstrated rapid clinical improvement\nwhile receiving levofloxacin only, collective clincal decision\nwas decided to treat the MRSA as a colonizer rather than a\npathogen.

Some\nreports indicate he was taking Tylenol PM to aide with sleep. He\nwas treated with activated charcoal and mucomyst (started 62.5\ncc/hr started at 9 am on [**2143-3-1**], stopped, likely at transfer at\n8 pm), and his Tylenol level improved. Ammonia level at\nadmission was 5, and coagulation profile was at baseline, so it\nwas not suspected that the patient was in fulminant failure.

Hepatic steatosis.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n53 year old woman with metastatic melanoma, adrenal\ninsufficiency, and NIDDM presenting with 3d of nausea, vomiting\nand abdominal pain found to have sinus tachycardia and severe\nheadache.\n.\n# Tachycardia: Review of recent outpatient vital signs suggests\npatient's baseline HR usually in the 90s-110s. With recent poor\nPO intake, her additional tachycardia is likely related to\nhypovolemia in the setting of her GI illness. History of nausea\nand vomiting suggests that she might not have been getting her\nmetoprolol which is also likely contributing. Her HR has\nreturned to the 90s with fluid resuscitation and her home\nmetoprolol dosing. Although the patient does have an underlying\nmalignancy and is thus at a higher risk for PE, there is no\nindication for CTA at this time since the tachycardia has\nresolved.\n.\n# Headache: Patient had a severe bilateral headache upon\npresentation which improved with rest, hydration, and small\namounts of dilaudid. No indication for urgent head imaging at\nthis time. Patient is scheduled for an upcoming outpatient head\nCT.\n.\n# Nausea/vomiting/diarrhea: Likely secondary to a viral\ngastroenteritis considering sick contacts and symptomatic\nimprovement. No new meds. No clear food precipitants. CT\nabdomen/pelvis negative for appendicitis or other acute\npathology. LFTs wnl. Symptomatic management with reglan and\nzofran. The patient's symptoms have resolved and she is\ntolerating a regular diet.\n.\n# Chest Discomfort: Notably worsened with food/drinking. Felt\nsecondary to acute worsening of GERD due to significant vomiting\nworsening esophageal acidity and inability to keep down her H2\nblocker. Cardiac enzymes negative and ekg w/o ischemic changes.\nImproved with improvement of vomiting and H2 blocker.\n.\n# U/A: Suggestive of UTI so patient was given a dose of\nciprofloxacin in the ED. She is asymptomatic so further\nantibiotics held in the MICU. Urine culture grew 10,000 to\n100,000 CFU of alpha-hemolytic strep. Since patient was not\nsymptomatic, this was not treated further.\n.\n# Adrenal insufficiency: Continued home prednisone 6mg daily.\n.\n# HTN: Continued metoprolol.\n.\n# Diabetes type 2: A1c: 11.4%. Patient has never been treated\nfor diabetes before. Monitored via insulin sliding scale\ninitially, though blood sugars poorly controlled. Added Lantus\nwith improvement in blood sugars.

Because of timing, pt\ndid not undergo stenting during cardiac cath, which showed.\nFollowing cath, she developed cardiogenic shock, for which she\nwas temporarily treated with an intra-aortic balloon pump,\nlevophed and milrinone. She was eventually weaned off all these.\nShe was started on aspirin, atorvastatin and digoxin. (She had\nbeen on OCPs on admission which were dc'd). TTE from [**2147-3-8**]\nshowed an EF of 25% with septal, anterior and apical akinesis. A\nrepeat TTE was performed on [**2147-3-16**] to assess for interval\nimprovement, but there was no change in cardiac function. Pt\nalso had low-grade fevers throughout her hospitalization. Prior\nto last admission, she was treated with a full course of\nciprofloxacin for a UTI. All blood cultures were negative and UA\nnegative. She was put on a five day course of vancomycin\nempirically for possible line infection (it was thought that she\nmay have had transient bacteremia from the catherization\ninstrumentation, even thought cultures were negative). She was\nalso given a five day course of azithromycin for a possible\ncommunity acquired PNA given a LUL infiltrate on CXR. Despite\nthe course of azithromycin, her fevers persisted and there was\nworsening of the left retrocardiac opacity. She was started on a\nseven day course of IV cefepime and vancomycin for hospital\nacquired pneumonia. A PICC line was placed in the left arm on\n[**2147-3-18**] for out-patient administration of IV antibiotics.\nDuring her stay, there was also concern for antiphospholipid\nantibody syndrome, given her MI at a young age, with few cardiac\nrisk factors and given elevated PTT. Testing for\nantiphospholipid antibodies was deferred in the in-patient\nsetting because of possible false positive results with acute\nillness and anticoagulation.\n.\nSince discharge, the patient has reportedly continued to have\nlow grade fevers at [**Hospital1 **]. She had a R PICC line placed on\n[**2147-3-23**] (unclear indication for placement). [**Name8 (MD) **] Crt has slowly\ntrended up over the past 7 days. The pt reportedly maintained\nnormal PO intake. She had low urine output and reportedly 25cc\non bladder scan. Her Hct dropped from 31.3 (on [**3-22**]) to 25.3 (on\n[**3-28**]). Her SBP at rehab ranged from high 80s-110s--she was in\nthe 90s on discharge from [**Hospital1 18**] according to notes available.\nShe then developed a rash--total body--on the day of\npresentation.\n.\nIn the [**Name (NI) **] pt. was febrile to 101.6, HR 100, BP 91/45, 19, 100 on\n2L. A pelvic exam was negative for foreign bodies. Renal US\nshowed no hydro. She was given tylenol, vanc, ceftaz and\nceftrioxone and 300cc of NS.\n\n.\nOn admission patient denied pain or compliants, otherwise does\nnot answer questions of verbally interact.\n\n\nPast Medical History:\nCardiac Risk Factors: -Diabetes, -Dyslipidemia, -Hypertension\n.\nCardiac History: NONE\n.\nOther PMH:\nMental Retardation\nSeizure disorder (?--listed in chart, but questionable per\ncaretakers, [**Name (NI) 74959**] added recently for mood)\nRecurrent UTIs\n\nSocial History:\nSocial history is significant for the absence of current tobacco\nuse.

There are no perinephric fluid collections.\nIMPRESSION:  No evidence of hydronephrosis or stones\n.\nEcho\nThe left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall\nthicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is\nnormal. LV systolic function appears moderately-to-severely\ndepressed (ejection fraction 30 percent) secondary to akinesis\nof the septum and apex, and hypokinesis of the anterior free\nwall. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular\nchamber size is normal. with focal hypokinesis of the apical\nfree wall. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally\nnormal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.\nThe mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no\nmitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.\nThe left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive\nfilling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. There\nis moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no\npericardial effusion.\nCompared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)\nof [**2147-3-16**], the heart rate is increased; otherwise the\nfindings are similar.\n.\nChest Xray\nFINDINGS:  In the interim, the pulmonary edema has reappeared.\nThe heart is persistently enlarged.  No pleural effusion.\nIMPRESSION:\n1.  Reappearance of pulmonary edema with no focal areas to\nsuggest pneumonia.\n2.  Persistent cardiomegaly.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nOn admission, renal consult was obtained and the patient became\nhypotensive on the floor.  She was transfered to the ICU when\nher BPs were not fluid responsive.  An aline was placed in the\nICU which registered BPs that were 15 points higher than those\nnoted on the cuff.  She was transiently put on dopamine but\nquickly weaned.  She was noted to have positive Cdiff and\nstarted on IV flagyl.  Per report of micu team, she is not\ntaking oral meds at this time because of a distrust of MDs.  BP\nstabilized and pt was transferred to the floor.\n.\nOn the floor the pt became dyspneic with O2 sat drops to the\nhigh 70s/low 80s, which responede to 70% facemask with O2 sats\nin the low 90s.  CXR showed pulm edema.  Pt was diuresed with\nresolution of dyspnea.  Soon after diuresis pt became\nhypotensive with SBP in the 80s but no symptoms.  Pt was fluid\nbolused and then became more dyspneic with repeat CXR showing\nworsenign pulm edema.  Because of this tenuous fluid balance\ndecision was made only to bolus IVF for SBP\u003c80 or for symptoms.\nWith these new criterea pt stabilized and was able to come off\nsupplemental O2 with O2 sats 94-96% on RA.  BP also stabilized.\nWhen SBP rose to 100-105 pt was restarted on Beta Blocker and\nACEI.\n.\nAs pt's hemodynamic and resp status improved she continued to\nrefuse PO meds, and when she would eat she would gag and vomit.\nInitially the etiology of this was unclear.  Pt was transintly\nsupported on TPN, S\u0026S eval ws unable to find a cause for\ndysphagia.  GI was consulted, and they preformed an EGD which\nshowed an non-obstructive Schotsky's ring, which was dilated.\nDespite this intervention dysphagia continued.  Pt's caretaker,\n[**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 4223**], came in to visit and reported that pt is a very\npicky eater, but when she finds something she likes she eats it\nvery quickly.  [**Doctor First Name **] brought in foods that she new the pt liked\n(including Pizza, Ice cream, and Diet Coke).  When the food was\ncut into very small peices the pt would eat it without\ndifficulty.  When drinking liquids the straw would need to be\npulled away after pt took a small sip, otherwise she would take\ntoo much and begin to gag and vomit.  Once this was made clear\nTPN was discontinued and pt was able to take adequat POs.  She\nalso was able to take PO meds as long as they are crushed and\nmixed in very well with either Diet Coke or Ice cream.\n\n # Hypoxia/tachypnea: As above.  Likely [**3-11**] CHF exacerbation and\nfluid shifts.  Stabilized by the time of discharge on Furosemide\n40 mg PO DAILY.\n.\n# Hypotension: Likely cardiogenic in setting of over-diuresis as\ndescibed above.  Pt's SBP stablized between 80-105 with no\nfurther complications for the last 6 days of her\nhospitalization.\n.\n#. C. Diff collitis: Pt completed a 14 day course of Flagyl in\nhouse.\n.\n# ARF:   Patient initially admitted for this reason.  Followed\nin house by renal team.  Urine sedement consistent with ATN;\nhowever the etiology was unclear, likely from hypotension or a\nhypovolemia.  Her Cdiff was treated and her blood pressures\nclosely monitored.  Cr recovered completely by the time of\ndischarge (creat=0.9)\n.\n# Hypernatremia:  Initially developed from poor po intake.  Her\nNa deficit was calculated and she was slowly repleted with D5W\nand hypernatremia resolved.\n.\n# Rash: Patient seen by derm and this was thought to be 'drug\ndermal hypersensivity,' likely [**3-11**] to abx use, unclear which one\nbut suspicious for cefepime.  The rash cleared completely by the\ntime of discharge.\n.\n# Coagulopathy: Pt was treated with coumadin due to low EF.  Pts\nINR elevated on admission, likely from interaction of coumadin\nand one of her antibiotics or other new meds.  Her EF was\nrechecked, and was still 30%.  Initially coumadin could not be\nrestarted because she was not taking PO meds, but then decision\nwas made to hold it due to substantial risk of fall and possible\nbleeding.  This issue should be readdressed as an outpatient\nafter rehab and when she has stabilized.\n.\n# Anemia: HCT has been trended down since [**3-7**] admission (HCT\nwas 35), stablized around ~25.  Labs consistent with anemia of\nchronic inflammation.\n.\n# CAD: known 100% LAD occlusion that was not able to be\nrevascularized.  Pt was treated with ASA and statin throughout\nher stay.  BB and ACEI were transiently held for hypotension,\nbut when BP stabilized they were restarted.\n.\n# CHF: EF of 30% in an LAD distribution (after STEMI w/ TO LAD).\nStarted on warfarin on D/C from [**Hospital1 18**] [**3-11**] to low EF. Coumadin\nwas held as descibed above.  Fluid overload treated as descibed\nabove.  Pt stabilized at time of discharge of Lasix 40 mg PO\ndaily.  She was treated with ASA, Statin, BB, and ACE I.\n.\n# Sz d/o: There was initial confusion about whether pt had\nhistory of seizure disorder and because she came in on\n[**Month/Day (2) 74959**].  When not taking POs she ws transiently switched over\nto IV keppra.  However, after speaking to father it was clear\nthat [**Month/Day (2) 74959**] was given for mood and pt had no history of\nseizure.  Therefore keppra was D/Ced and [**Month/Day (2) 74959**] was not\nrestarted.\n.\n#. Nutrition: As described above.\n\nMedications on Admission:\n1. Aspirin 325 mg Tablet, Delayed Release (E.C.)

Please evaluate chest and abdomen with\nIV contrast.\n\nTECHNIQUE: CT scan evaluation of the chest, abdomen and pelvis\nwas performed with IV contrast using 5 mm collimation. Images\nwere reformatted and evaluated in both the coronal and sagittal\nplanes.\n\nCOMPARISON: Comparison is made to prior CT scans of the\ncervical, thoracic and lumbar spines.\n\nFINDINGS: There is a nondisplaced fracture through the\nmanubrium. A small amount of retromanubrial hematoma is\nidentified.\n\nAs seen in the recent CT examination, there is a complex\nfracture involving the T4 vertebral body. There is approximately\n80% compression of this vertebral body and 25 degrees of\nkyphosis at this level. Bilateral pars fractures are also\nidentified at T4, representing posterior column injury. Moderate\ncanal narrowing and angulation is noted at this level.

Nonionic IV contrast was used as a rapid\nbolus as necessary for this study. 100 cc of Optiray 250 were\nused.\n\nMultiplanar reconstructions were performed.\n\nCT OF THE CHEST: There are no significant axillary lymph nodes.\nThere are multiple small AP window lymph nodes that do not meet\nCT criteria for pathology. There is no pericardial effusion. The\nheart is mildly enlarged. The aorta appears to be intact. The\npulmonary artery is slightly enlarged measuring 2 cm, which may\nrepresent chronic pulmonary artery hypertension. Clinical\ncorrelation is recommended. This is unchanged to [**2186-9-16**]. The pulmonary artery branches are patent. There are no\nfilling defects which suggest pulmonary embolism. There are mild\ncalcifications of the coronary arteries. The suggestion of\nenlargement of the left pulmonary artery as seen in the chest\nradiograph is likely due to atelectasis of left upper lobe\nposteriorly and superior segment of left lower lobe. The\nappearance of the pulmonary artery is unchanged compared to the\nprior study.\n\nExamination of the lung windows again demonstrate paraseptal\nemphysema with multiple subpleural blebs. There is interval\nworsening of the atelectasis of the posterior aspect of the\nbilateral upper lobes and lower lobes. There is basically\ncomplete atelectasis of the bilateral lower lobes. Most of the\nsegmental branches, however, are patent with the exception of\nthe superior segment of the left lower lobe where you can see an\nabrupt cut off.. There are very small bilateral pleural\neffusions. There are minimal atelectasis in the right middle\nlobe.\n\nLimited images of the upper abdomen do not demonstrate\nsignificant abnormality.\n\nBONE WINDOWS: Again noted complex unstable fracture of T4 which\nis unchanged in appearance when compared to the prior study. The\ndegree of angulation also appears to be unchanged. As is the\nnarrowing of the spinal canal. Note that this fracture involves\nthe anterior, medial and posterior columns as described in\ndetail in the CT of the thoracic spine. Also the appearance of\nthe compression fracture of T7 is also unchanged when compared\nto the prior study. No definite sternal fracture can be seen.\n\nMultiplanar reconstructions were important to better evaluate\nthe bone alignment.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.\n\n2. The apparent enlargement of the left pulmonary artery is\nsecondary to the overlapping of the atelectasis of the posterior\naspect of the left upper lobe and superior segment of the left\nlower lobe.\n\n3. Interval worsening of bilateral atelectasis involving the\nposterior aspect of the upper lobes and the bilateral lower\nlobes. This is described above in detail.\n\n4.

Elective\ntracheostomy was also done on [**6-6**].  She tolerated the procedure\nwell.  She required oxygen by trach mask.  She initially\nrequired quite a lot of suctioning but was later able to clear\nsecretions mostly on her own.

She will\nalso [**Hospital1 4939**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for possible chemotherapy.\n.\n#. Pneumonia: There was concern that the patient may have had an\naspiration event complicated by pneumonia following her\ntracheostomy procedure. Her WBC count rose to 18.6 two days\nfollowing the procedure, although she never manifested a clear\ninfiltrate on CXR and was not febrile.  Sputum cultures were\nobtained but no pathogens were isolated.  She was initially\ntreated with five days of levofloxacin; this was broadened to\npip/tazo on when she developed increased secretions.  Her\nsecretions have since diminished.  She completed 5 days of\npip/tazo for a total 10 day course.\n.\n#. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: She had no prior hx of a-fib\nbefore admission, however, while monitored in the ICU she had at\nleast three episodes of paroxysmal Afib.  Cardiac enzymes were\nnegative.  She remained in sinus rhythm following this.\nMetoprolol was given at 37.5 mg TID; upon discharge it was\nchanged to 50 mg [**Hospital1 **].\n.\n#. Dysphagia: she had difficulty with swallowing since prior to\nadmission. Following her tracheostomy, she had coughing after\nattempting PO intake.  She had aspiration during her swallowing\nevalulation as.  Laproscopic G tube placement was performed on\n[**6-10**].  She is tolerating tube feedings very well and remains\nNPO. Free water flushes were increased to 250 Q4 hours due to\nhypernatremia.\n.\n#. Pleural Effusions: These were relatively stable on CXR.\nHowever, given her effusions and peripheral edema, we felt she\nwarrented evaluation for CHF.  Echo showed normal EF (\u003e55%),\nmild atrial dilation, moderate PA systolic hypertension.\nShe was oxygenating well and it was felt she did not need\nmaintenance lasix.\n.\n#. Hypertension: Her lisinopril was stopped in favor of rate\ncontrol with metoprolol (following episode of paroxysmal Afib).\nAs BPs have been normal to high, her metoprolol may need to be\ntitrated up.

Given his recent history of atrial fibrillation\nand ventricular tachycardia, an electrophysiology consult was\nobtained. Amiodarone was continued and an ICD postoperatively\nwas considered. He was found to be inducible for ventricular\ntachycardia during a study and left ventricular mapping\ndemonstrated a basilar scar. Intraoperative ablation was thus\nalso recommended. His pacemaker was interrogated and his\nunderlying rhythm was found to be complete heart block. A right\ngroin ultrasound was obtained which revealed a common femoral\nartery/vein fistula. Keflex was started for phlebitis. Vitamin K\nwas given to get his INR to an appropriate level for surgery. On\n[**2133-9-2**], Mr. [**Known lastname 63063**] was taken to the operating room where he\n[**Known lastname 1834**] a mitral valve replacement with a 27mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**]\nPorcine valve, a cryo MAZE for atrial fibrillation, placement of\nbiventricular pacing leads, cryoablation for VT and a left\natrial appendage ligation. Postoperatively he was taken to the\ncardiac surgical intensive care unit for monitoring. On\npostoperative day one, coumadin was resumed. On postoperative\nday two, Mr. [**Known lastname 63063**] was extubated. The EP (Electrophysiology\nService) made changes to his pacemaker as his epicardial pacing\nwires were not capturing. Later on postoperative day two, Mr.\n[**Known lastname 63063**] was reintubated for respiratory distress and several\nepisodes of ventricular tachycardia. Amiodarone and lidocaine\nwere loaded. He was gently diuresed. Beta blockade was started\nand titrated as his blood pressure could tolerate. The EP\nservice recommended an AICD when ready. The pulmonary service\nwas consulted for his respiratory failure. A CT Scan was\nperformed which was suggestive of pneumonia and bronchovascular\nnodules. Antibiotics were started. Mr. [**Known lastname 63063**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] a\nbronchoscopy for large amounts of secretions and mucus plugging.\nA repeat echocardiogram was performed which was not suggestive\nof a patent foramen ovale. On [**2133-9-11**], Mr. [**Known lastname 63063**] was\nsuccessfully extubated. A speech and swallow consult was\nobtained and Mr. [**Known lastname 63063**] was found to be aspirating this\nliquids. He remained on tube feeds. On [**2133-9-12**], Mr. [**Known lastname 63063**]\ndeveloped respiratory distress again and was reintubated. The\nrenal service was consulted for uremia and an elevated\ncreatinine. His medications were renal dosed and intravenous\nfluids were started for acute tubular necrosis.  Zosyn,\nlevofloxacin and vancomycin were continued for his pneumonia. An\nechocardiogram was performed which showed a well seated mitral\nvalve and a borderline depressed ejection fraction. An abdominal\nultrasound was performed for an elevated amylase and lipase\nwhich was normal. A CT scan of his abdomen was obtained which\nrevealed enlarged mesenteric, retroperitoneal and retrocrural\nlymph nodes and no pancreatitis.  Creatinine rose to 3.2\n(baseline 1.1-1.7), with BUN 101 and sodium of 150 on [**9-14**].\nRenal was consulted and felt that acute renal failure likely\nrelated to aggressive diuresis in the setting of repeat\nextubations.  Recommended renal dosing medications (Zosyn) and\nkeeping BP elevated with colloid infusion for improved renal\nperfusion.  Creatinine continued to rise and renal was concerned\nthat prerenal picture had turned into ATN picture.  FENa however\nwas calculated at 0.43% and Renal advised normal saline\ninfusion.  Trach and PEG placed on [**2133-9-15**].  At this point,\nthere was a concern for worsening heart failure.  Renal function\nimproved to 3.1 on [**9-19**] and 2.6 on [**9-20**]. Vancomycin and\nmetronidazole were started on [**9-19**] and were stopped on [**9-21**].\nHe was started on bicarbonate given low bicarb level and\nnon-anion gap metabolic acidosis with inadequate respiratory\ncompensation.  Amiodarone was restarted and dosing changed\nperiodically per EP recs.  The patient was transferred to the\nMICU due to nursing concerns.\n.\nMICU COURSE:\nUnder MICU service care he was treated for renal failure with\nCVVHD which was eventually transitioned to IHD on [**2133-11-4**]. It\nwas belived to be due from ATN as muddy brown casts were seen.\nIt was hoped that his renal function would improve.\nHe was weaned from the Pressure Support ventilator to trach mask\nventilation. After a lengthy course of antibiotics, he was found\nto have Clostridium difficile in his stool. He was started on\nmetronidazole. Also, beta blockers were attempted on multiple\noccasions in addition to the amiodarone. First, metoprolol was\ntried and the pt became hypotensive and had poor mentation. This\nwas dc'd and the pt subsequently did well. Then a few days later\n(on [**11-8**]), the patient was tried on Coreg with similar results.\nNo additional beta blockers were tried as the amiodarone was all\nhe could tolerate in addition to the HD.\n.\n1. Respiratory failure: He was intubated in the setting of his\nsurgery, and had three failed atempts at extubation, requiring\ntrach tube placement. He required varying levels of pressure\nsupport and assist control throughout his stay depending on his\nclinical condition. For several days before discharge he was\ntolerating trach mask with .95 FiO2. He occassionally has\ndesaturations requiuring return to pressure support, but overall\ntolewrates trach mask ventilllation well. At the time of\ndischarge he was on trach mask.  His respiratory difficulties\nwere likely due to underlying lung disease, large pleural\neffusions, and pulmonary edema. The plan is to wean [**Last Name (un) 834**]\nventilator and have him on trach mask for as much of the day as\ntolerated. When requiring pressure support he has been on 12 of\npressure support and 8 of PEEP.\n.\n2. Renal failure: He has a history of chronic kidney disease\n(baseline creatinine 1.1-1.6). Acute renal failure thought to be\ndue to ATN and prerenal state from poor foward flow. Of note, he\nreceived IV contrast for CT study on [**9-25**], which correlates with\nthe time at which his Cr began rising. Continually rising Cr and\ndecreased UOP led to the initiation of CVVHD.  CVVHD was\ntransitioned to HD, which began on [**2133-10-12**].  The Pt. was\ncontinued on epoitin at [**Numeric Identifier 2686**] QMWF. He is currently in oliguric\nrenal failure getting IHD MWF. He may have reversable kidney\nfailure, though unlikely, so he should be follwed up by a\nnephrologist to determine further need for dialysis.\n.\n3. Pancreatitis: Had varying levels of amylase and lipase\nelevation during stay. Multiple etiologies, including\nmedications, post-op/ischemic, hypertriglycerides,  other GI\ncause, or renal failure. He is abdominal pain free on discharge\nand will likely continue to have asymptomatic elevation in\namylase and lipase.\n.\n4. Peritonitis: He had apparent leakage from around his G tube\nin to his peritoneum, evident on CT of abd. He [**Numeric Identifier 1834**] exlap\n([**2133-10-8**]) and had repair of gastric wall perforation and\nplacement of J tube. Intra-op peritoneal cultures grew out\nPseudomonas aerginosa and [**Female First Name (un) **] glabrata, for which he\nreceived a 28 day course of ambisome/imipenum/flagyl. He\nsubsequently has been fed through his J tube and his G tube\nshould remain clamped and in place indefinately.\n\n5. Sepsis: He had several episodes of sepsis with no obvious\nsource other than his prior peritoneal infection. No blood\ncultures were ever positive.\n.\n6. CHF: EF preserved after MVR, diastolic dysfunction. Given\nrenal failure, pt was dependent on hemodialysis and CVVH\nintermittently for fluid removal. He has Bilateral pleural\neffusions, which are chronic, and transudative on multiple taps.\nHe should have fluid removed with dialysis. If possible, though\nhis blood presure would not tolerate it, we would like him to be\non a beta blocker and an ACE inh for his heart failure.\n.\n6. Refractory monomorphic VT. The pt received a lidocaine bolus\nand was started on amiodarone gtt for recurrent brief runs of\nVT.  Continued on heparin gtt after MAZE procedure for atrial\nfibrillation, currently awaiting ICD placement.  He was\neventually placed on an oral dose of amiodarone which controlled\nhis ventricular ectopy but was unable to tolerate beta blocker\nfor PVC prevention, rate control of AF or CHF given low BP. Plan\nwas made to place ICD by having him return to [**Hospital1 18**]  after his\ndischarge from rehab in [**Doctor Last Name **]. If any questions, please\ncall Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 34490**] office for scheduling([**Telephone/Fax (1) 5862**].\n.\n7. Psych: Delirium - He was noted to be have delusions on\nseveral occasions. Possible etiologies include medications,\ninfection, uremia, and ICU confusion. He tolerated olanzepine\nQAM and QHS.  Depression - He had previously been on zoloft, but\nit was discontinued per psychiatry as it was a very small dose\nand there was concern for polypharmacy.\n.\n8. Adrenal Insufficiency- thought to have adrenal insufficinency\ngiven improvement in blood pressure while on steroids. He was\ndischarged on Prednisone taper. Please taper slowly.\n.\n9. Chronic Leukemia- type unknown, likely explains frequent\nleuko and lymphocytosis; no acute concerns. Contact pts primary\nhematologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 63064**] in RI if questions, [**Telephone/Fax (1) 63065**]\n.\n10. Left psoas hematoma: stable. no evidence of expansion on\nsubsequent CT scans. Likely due to spontaneous bleed in the\nsetting of supertherapeutic anticoagulation for his AFib/Maze\nprocedure.\n.\n11.ID: Vent Associated Pneumonia: He was treated with vancomycin\nand zosyn for pseudomonas and coag-positive staph aureus\npneumonia. He continued to have pseudomonas in his sputum\nthroughout his stay. Peritonitis: Following surgery,\nrecommendations were for empiric treatment with vancomycin,\nlevofloxacin, metronidazole, and fluconazole.  On [**2133-10-11**],\nperitoneal fluid culture grew non-Candidal yeast and\npseudomonas.  The antibiotic regimen was adjusted to vancomycin,\nmetronidazole, ambisome, cefepime, and gentamicin after\ndiscussion with ID. This was later consolidated to imipenum,\nvancomycin, and ambisome for a total 28 day course. C. Diff:\ntreating with IV flagyl 7 day course to end on [**2133-11-14**].\n.\n12. Abdominal wound: surgical wound from ex lap. Initially\nclosed with staples. Wound dehisced after staples removed 3\nweeeks after surgery. Allowing to heal by secondary intention\n.\n13. DM: was variably on fixed dose insulin, insulin drip, and\nsliding scale insulin to control blood sugars. He will need his\nglargine adjusted asd the prednisone is tapered. Please also\nconsider adding ASA as patient is diabetic without coroary\ndisease.\n.\n14. FEN: The long term nutrition goal during the hospitalization\nwas to transition from parenteral nutrition to tube feeds.  The\noriginial PEG tube placed on [**2133-9-15**] yielded high residuals\nwhen tube feeds were started, and goal rate could not be met,\neven with trials of reglan and IV erythromycin.  Plan was to\nadvance tube to post-pyloric position, but before this occurred,\nthe Pt. [**Date Range 1834**] surgery for perforated viscus, and a new\nG-tube and J-tube were placed.  Post-operative J-tube tube feeds\nwere well tolerated, and parenteral nutrition was d/c'd.  G tube\nis clamped and remains in place but should never be used. Per\nDr.[**Name (NI) 1381**] surgery team, the tube should never be pulled given\nhigh risks for infection and perforation. If fully\nrehabilitated, pt may discuss having tubes pulled with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 816**]\nor other primary providers as an outpatient in the distant\nfuture.\n.\n15.

Patient may have also been on larger than usual\ndoses of home narcotics. By time of arrival to the floor,\npatient's lethargy had resolved. Her orthostatics were negative.\nHer EKG did not show any acute ST-T changes, and overnight\ntelemetry showed no events. She was noted to have an old infarct\non MRI, but no new infarcts to explain her initial lethargy.\n.\nPatient was noted to have severe iron deficiency anemia, and was\nstarted on iron replacement and given a transfusion of pRBC,\nduring which she developed pleuritic chest pain and tachycardia.\nAn EKG was performed, which showed sinus tachycardia. Her CXR\ndid not show any acute changes, and patient was given\nnitroglycerin with symptomatic relief. She had cardiac enzymes\nand a D-dimer checked as well, with negative cardiac enzymes but\nwith an elevated D-dimer. Patient was scheduled for a CTA at the\ntime to assess for pulmonary embolus. She then proceeded to\nfinish her blood transfusion without incident. Prior to\nreceiving the CT scan, patient developed acute SOB, tachypnea\nwith RR 30s and tachycardia again, and a code was called due to\nsuspicion for massive pulmonary embolus.\n.\nShe was found to be tachycardic, tachypneic and diaphoretic,\nstill complaining of L sided pleuritic chest pain. She was\ntransferred to the MICU. Her initial ABG was 7.33/39/115. A\nheparin gtt was empirically started, and she was taken urgently\nfor a stat CTA. CTA did not show evidence for a PE so the\nheparin gtt was stopped.  Pt responded well to morphine and\nnebs. Her CT chest showed ground glass opacities suggestive of\npulmonary edema, and the etiology of the acute episode of chest\npain was thought to be secondary to flash pulmonary edema. She\nwas treated with IV lasix and symptoms improved.  An echo was\nobtained and showed an EF of 20% with 3+ MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], but she had\nno prior echos here for comparison. Since the pt's symptoms\nimproved she was transferred to a regular medicine floor.\n.\nPatient's dilated cardiomyopathy was thought secondary to\ncocaine use and HIV. A cholesterol panel was checked, as well as\na TSH and RPR. She was started on lisinopril and metoprolol,\nwhich were titrated up for goal systolic blood pressure in the\n80-90s. She was also started on digoxin, and will need\noutpatient followup of her digoxin level. A cardiology consult\nwas called to evaluate if patient would need acute inpatient\nworkup for ischemia as a cause of her cardiomyopathy. Cardiology\nconsult recommended that patient undergo an evaluation for\nendocarditis given her degree of valvular regurgitation. Patient\nhad blood cultures drawn which were all negative at time of\ndischarge. She had a TEE performed, which was negative for\nvegetation. Patient was placed on a fluid restriction as well.\nDecision was made not to start her on standing furosemide and\naldactone as well given her low systolic blood pressures. She\nwill be started on these as an outpatient in followup with her\nPCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was maintained on telemetry with no events seen. She\nwill follow up in cardiology, and she will need teaching from\nthe heart failure clinic, as well as an outpatient\ncatheterization to be scheduled to evaluate for ischemia.\n.\nPatient was also foudn to have a positive urinalysis, and was\nstarted on levofloxacin given her history of enterococcal UTIs.\nShe had a renal ultrasound performed with persistent\nhydronephrosis. Patient was seen by urology as an inpatient and\noutpatient and was recommended for outpatient lithotripsy in two\nweeks. She will continue her antibiotics for a total 14 day\ncourse.\n.\nPatient was continued on combivir and viramune. She was actively\nusing cocaine at time of admission. She had a urine toxicology\nscreen positive for cocaine and opiates. Patient's pain was\ncontrolled with her home doses of amitryptylline, morphine, and\ntrazadone. Patient had lung nodules seen as well on CT scan,\nwhich were stable from prior imaging. She was discharged home\nwith follow up with her primary care doctor.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nViramune, Combivir, Trazadone 150\nmg, Morphine 30 mg b.i.d., Topamax, Detrol-LA and Elavil 50 mg.\n\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.

Coronary angiography in this left-dominant system revealed\ndiffuse\ncoronary artery disease.  The LMCA was a small caliber vessel\nwithout\ndisease.  The LAD had 60-70% calcified stenoses of the proximal\nsection,\nas well as the diagonal branch, and was occluded after the\nmid-section.\nThe LCX had sequential stenoses of the proximal and distal LCX,\nwith\noccluded OM1 and OM2 branches, and total occlusion after the\ndistal LCX.\nThe RCA was a non-dominant vessel with sequential 80% stenoses.\n2. Selective graft venography revealed a widely patent SVG-PDA\nand LPL\ngraft.  The SVG-OM1 graft had a 30-40% stenosis in the mid-SVG,\nand was\npatent to the OM1 branch.\n3. Selective graft arteriography revealed a widely patent\nLIMA-LAD\ngraft.\n4. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right- and left-sided\nfilling\npressures, with mean RA pressure of 15 mmHg, and mean PCW\npressure of 30\nmmHg.  The wedge tracing was notable for a prominant v-wave with\n\npressure of 51 mmHg, consistent with possible mitral\nregurgitation.\nThere was mild pulmonary hypertension with mean PA pressure of\n38 mmHg,\nand mild systemic hypertension, with SBP of 140mmHg.  The\ncardiac output\nwas normal at 5.1 L/min.  There was no aortic stenosis detected\nby\npullback technique.\n5. Nonselective left subclavian injection revealed a 70%\nstenosis of the\nproximal left subclavian artery, with a 45 mmHg pressure drop\nacross the\nstenotic lesion.\n\nFINAL DIAGNOSIS:\n1. Diffuse coronary artery disease.\n2. Elevated left- and right-sided filling pressures.\n3. Mild pulmonary and systemic hypertension.\n4. Subclavian stenosis.\n\nCXR ([**2142-6-10**]):\nIMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly, bilateral airspace opacity, right\ngreater than\nleft, concerning for pulmonary edema with bilateral pleural\neffusions, also greater on the right.\n\nEcho ([**2142-6-12**]):\nThe left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric\nleft ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is\nmildly dilated. LV systolic function appears\nmoderately-to-severelydepressed (ejection fraction 30 percent)\nsecondary to akinesis of the posterior wall and hypokinesis of\nthe inferior septum, anterior free wall, and apex. Tissue\nDoppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling\npressure (PCWP\u003e18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free\nwall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly\nthickened but aortic stenosis is not present. The mitral valve\nleaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve\nprolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The\ntricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]\ntricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary\nartery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.\n\nA possible discontinuity in the myocardium between the inferior\nand posterior wall at the basal level is seen. The discontinuity\noccurs where normal inferior wall meets akinetic posterior wall.\nThis could represent a contained pseudoaneurysm of the left\nventricle. This finding was present on the prior study.\n\nCompared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)\nof [**2142-5-1**], the mitral regurgitation is increased.\n\nCT Chest ([**2142-6-13**]):\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Severe coronary artery atherosclerosis. Anemia.\n2. Likely asymmetric pulmonary edema. Contribution of drug\nreaction, for\nexample amiodarone toxicity, pulmonary hemorrhage or aspiration\ncannot be\nassessed in the setting of cardiac decompensation.\n3. Asbestos-related pleural plaques. Basal rounded atelectasis,\ngreater on\nthe right, stable for three years.\n4. Mild-to-moderate emphysema apical predominant.\n\nAbd Ultrasound ([**2142-6-14**]):\nIMPRESSION:\n1. No hydronephrosis.\n2. Normal liver Doppler.\n3. No extra- or intra-hepatic biliary duct dilatation.\n\nCT A/P ([**2142-6-14**]):\n1. No evidence of retroperitoneal hemorrhage or hemorrhage in\nthe left groin (the site of recent catheterization).\n2. New bilateral basal consolidations, likely relate to\naspiration.\n3. Small amount of simple ascites, new since prior study.\n4. Extensive atherosclerotic disease.\n\nGallbladder U/S ([**2142-6-17**]):\n1. No evidence of acute cholecystitis or intra- or extra-hepatic\nbiliary\nductal dilation.\n2. A echogenic focus in the gallbladder neck measuring 1.2 cm,\ncould either represent a polyp, adherent sludge or a\nnon-calcified stone. Follow-up evaluation upon resolution of\nacute symptoms is recommended.\n\nCXR ([**2142-6-19**]):\nAP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient\nsitting\nsemi-upright position. Available for comparison is a preceding\nsimilar study dated [**2142-6-17**]. During the two days examination\ninterval, the patient has been extubated. Comparison of heart\nsize obtained in portable AP position suggests mild regression\nof cardiac enlargement. This is also supported by the less\nmarked perivascular haze previously noted in the pulmonary\ncirculation. Although the diaphragmatic contours are now again\nvisible, although blunting of the lateral pleural sinuses\npersists, indicating some remaining pleural effusion. Previously\ndescribed left internal jugular approach central venous line as\nwell as a similar right-sided line persist.  The latter still\ncarrying the Swan-Ganz catheter seen to reach the central\nportion of the right PA. No evidence of pneumothorax or newly\ndeveloped discrete pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates that would\nindicate the presence of pneumonia in this patient with\nleukocytosis.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n** PATIENT WAS DISCHARGED AGAINST MEDICAL ADVICE ON [**2142-6-23**] **\n\nMr. [**Known lastname 17029**] is a 65 year-old man with CAD s/p previous CABG\nwho was admitted w/ shortness of breath, transferred to the CCU\nfor SOB and hypoxia.\n\n1. HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE- This was likely exacerbated in\nthe setting of pulmonary edema with possible superimposed\ninfection. Volume overload and newly diagnosed mitral\nregurgitation also contributed to difficulty breathing. Pt was\nintubated on [**6-12**] for increasing respiratory distress. He was\ntreated with an 8-day course of vanc/cefepime for aspiration\npneumonia. He was initially diuresed with lasix boluses and\nlasix drip, but due to poor urine output and increasing\ncreatinine, drip was discontinued. On [**6-13**], diurses with lasix\nboluses and metolazone was initiated and renal was consulted,\nwho recommended starting CVVH. On [**6-14**], pt started diuresis with\nCVVHD for pulmonary edema in setting of worsening MR. CVVH was\ncontinued until [**6-18**]. Pt was extubated on [**6-17**], without\ncomplications. In the setting of aggressive diuresis, pt's\nrespiratory status continued to improved and he was called-out\nto the floor on [**6-21**]. Pt was comfortable on room air, prior to\ndischarge when he chose to be released AGAINST MEDICAL ADVICE on\n[**2142-6-23**].\n\n2. ACUTE ON CHRONIC SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE: Patient was\nclinically volume overloaded and cardiac catheterization showed\nevidence of new MR (but patent grafts). Patient had little\ndiuresis with IV lasix on the general medical floors, and was\ntransfered to the CCU due to increasing oxygen requirement. He\nrequired intubation in the setting of aspiration while on\nfacemask, with desaturation to 70%. While intubated, he had\nlittle output to lasix, and required CVVH for a net of [**11-27**]\nliters off. As he approached the euvolemic state, he was\nsuccessfully extubated. He was maintained on beta blocker,\nplavix, and statin. ACEi was not started given ARF, but should\nbe considered in future. Optimized afterload reduction in\nsetting of new MR [**First Name (Titles) 151**] [**Last Name (Titles) **].\n\n3. ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: This was likely in setting of\npoor forward flow (Fe Urea 16%) s/p CVVH.  Electrolytes\nacceptable, volume status much improved and appeared to be\neuvolemic on exam. Pt's urine output improved. CVVH continued\nuntil [**6-18**] and pt underwent hemodialysis on [**6-19**].  His creatinine\ntrended downwards without the need for regular hemodyalysis.\nPatient LEFT AGAINST MEDICAL ADVICE on [**6-23**] before further\nparameters could be discussed.\n\n4. ATRIAL FLUTTER: Patient demonstrated new slow aflutter in the\nCCU. He underwent bedside cardioversion on [**6-15**] and converted to\nnormal sinus rhythm. For rate control, beta blocker and\namiodarone were initiated. Initially he was maintained on\nheparin gtt which was later transitioned to coumadin.\n\n5. HYPERTENSION:  Pt was continued on [**Month/Year (2) **]/ metoprolol.\nOptimized with goal SBP??????s 100-110??????s and HR 60??????s.  Of note,\npatient had left-sided subclavian stenosis (proximal LIMA) with\ndisparate blood pressure in upper extremities. [**Month (only) 116**] consider\nintervention for subclavian stenosis as outpatient (not done as\ninpatient in cath given the dye load and renal failure)\n\n6. TRANSAMINITIS: Pt's LFTs were consistent with cholestatic\npicture- he had a negative RUQ U/S and CT initially, but repeat\nRUQ showed a questionable stone in the gallbladder neck vs\nechogenic focus, but this was non- obstructing. There could be\nsome component of congestion, but could be also medication\neffect from Statin or Zosyn. Atorvastatin was decreased from\n80mg to 40mg daily and initial zosyn for hospital-acquired\npneumonia coverage was changed to cefepime. LFT's were carefully\nmonitored throughout hospital course and trended downward.\n\n7.  ANEMIA: Unclear etiology. There were no signs of active\nbleeding on exam.  His Hct increased appropriately after 4 units\nPRBC transfusion. Pt underwent abdominal CT on [**6-14**] to rule-out\nretroperitoneal bleed given recent catheterization on [**6-11**].\nThere was no evidence of RP bleed on CT. His hemolysis labs were\nnegative.  His blood pressures and HCTs remained stable\nthroughout the remainder of his hospital course and he did not\nrequire further blood transfusions.\n\n8. Diabetes mellitus type II: insulin was continued per\noutpatient regimen\n\n9. Diabetic foot ulcer: s/p R- TMA. Incision was clean, no\nevidence of infection at this time, sutures intact. Seen by\nvascular surgery as inpatient, who recommended outpatient\nfollow-up.\n\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\n# Atorvastatin 40 mg Tablet Daily.\n# Clopidogrel 75 mg Tablet Daily.\n# Aspirin 325 mg Tablet Daily.\n# [**Month/Year (2) 23928**] 10 mg Daily.\n# Metoprolol Tartrate 50 mg 2 times a day.\n.\n# Lorazepam 0.5 mg every 4 hours as needed for anxiety.\n# Sertraline 100 mg Daily.\n# Temazepam 15 mg Capsule PO HS as needed for insomnia.\n.\n# Heparin (Porcine) 5,000 TID (3 times a day).\n# Acetaminophen 325 mg for pain, fever.\n# Oxycodone-Acetaminophen 5-325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO\nQ6H (every 6 hours) as needed for pain.\n# Ranitidine HCl 150 mg Tablet\n.\n# Humalog Sliding Scale\n# NPH Insulin\n- 20 Units AM, and 24 Units PM\n# Humalog\n- 10 units with breakfast, 12 units with dinner\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.

During this admission, she was found to have 3 vessel\ndisease with 100% RCA occlusion . She underwent cardiac\ncatheterization on  [**2183-4-9**] and had baremetal stent/hepacoat\nstents to RCA.\n\nOn arrival to the CCU, she had acute respiratory acidosis\nprobably due to excessive sedation. She was intubated for 2 days\nand was extubated on [**4-11**] without complication. Her CVP was kept\nin the range of 13-15mmHg to maintain her preload given the RV\ninvolvement. Her cardiac index gradually improved and she was\nweaned off IABP and pressors on [**4-12**] without complication.\nEchocardiogram was done on [**4-10**] for concern of VSD given high\nmixed venous.It was negative for VSD/ASD and showed EF of 30%,\nakinesis of inferior septum and inferior free wall, severe\nhypokinesis of posterior wall, no AS, no AI, 1+MR. As her RV\nrecovers, she no longer needed the high CVP and was diuresed\neasily with lasix.\n\nPatient had complete heart block and then 2nd degree type II\nblock while in the cath lab. Temporary pacing wire was placed\nand was then removed in the CCU. She remained in 1st degree\nheart block throughout her stay with premature atrial beats\noccasionally. On [**2183-4-14**], she went into atrial fibrillation and\nfailed metoprolol and calcium channel blocker. She was DC\ncardioverted back to NSR. Amiodarone was started and given that\nshe had an MI and was acutely ill, it was decided that she\nshould be kept on amiodarone for one month. Her TSH was normal.\n\nWhile in the CCU, she developed bouts of diarrhea which turned\nout to be C.diff negative. SHe also had a lot of gas and\nbelching which caused her to be nauseous. Her EKG was unchanged.\nShe became better after being out of bed.

At this time, he was also with some\ncomplaint of chest pain. The patient was treated with\naspirin, morphine and Lovenox. He presented to the [**Hospital6 1760**] Emergency Department where he\nwas seen by Vascular Surgery who recommended starting him on\nheparin for questionable arterial clot and vascular\ninsufficiency. The patient was also seen by the Cardiology\nservice in the Emergency Department who did a bed side\nechocardiogram, which showed no definite thrombus in his left\natrium. In the Emergency Room, his vital signs were as\nfollows:  Temperature 98.4, heart rate 90, blood pressure\n98/palp, 96 percent on two liters nasal cannula. His [**Known lastname **]\nblood cell count was 16.3. The patient was transferred to the\nMedical Intensive Care Unit on [**2153-5-19**] for a labile blood\npressure.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease, status post\nmyocardial infarction two years ago. Chronic obstructive\npulmonary disease on home O2 requirement, dementia, bilateral\nbolus pemphigoid, history of seizures, bilateral THR, status\npost right arm bypass of brachial artery twenty years ago.\n\nHOME MEDICATIONS:\n1. Imdur 30 mg q d.\n2. Prednisone 7.5 mg q d.\n3. Theophylline 200 mg q d.\n4. Vitamin B-12.\n5. Multivitamin.\n6. Lovastatin 20 mg q d.\n7. Tetracycline 600 mg b.i.d.\n8. Ativan 0.5 mg t.i.d.\n\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives in [**Location (un) 18437**]. He has\na son and daughter who are both involved in his medical care.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 98.6, heart rate 119,\nblood pressure 120/70, respiratory rate 20, O2 saturation 95\npercent on four liters nasal cannula. HEENT:  Poor dentition.\nPupils equal, round and reactive to light. Extraocular\nmovements intact. Chest:  Bilateral diffuse rhonchi. Moving\nair well. Cardiovascular:  Distant cardiac sounds. Normal S1,\nS2, tachycardiac but with regular rhythm. Abdomen:  Soft,\nnontender, nondistended, no pulsatile masses. Extremities:\nMultiple erosions on his lower extremities, nonpalpable\npulses throughout. His right arm was blue in color with pale,\n[**Known lastname **] fingertips. No pulse was Dopplerable. A pulse was\nDopplerable at his right axilla. His left arm was oozing\nserosanguinous fluid. It was red in color.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was transferred to the Medical\nIntensive Care Unit on [**2153-5-19**] for persistent hypotension\non the floor. The cause of his hypotension was unknown and\nbecause the patient did have an elevated [**Known lastname **] blood cell\ncount, he was treated with empiric antibiotics; vancomycin,\nlevofloxacin and Flagyl. The goal was to keep his mean\narterial pressures greater than 60. He received 250 cc\nintravenous fluid boluses to help accomplish this. He was\nalso started on Neo-Synephrine. With this, his pressures\nimproved. His urine output remained somewhat stable at\napproximately 25 cc per hour. He was seen by Vascular\nSurgery. The patient underwent an angiogram through the left\nfemoral artery, which revealed that his twenty year old\nbypass graft on his right arm was completely occluded. The\npatient's arm remained cool and cold and mildly tender. His\npain was controlled well with morphine. The heparin drip was\ncontinued. Because the patient had likely ischemia greater\nthan twenty-four hours, the chances of him recovering\nfunction of his right hand was minimal, thus, a surgical\nprocedure to reestablish flow was not indicated. The options\nincluded amputation and/or pain control as the patient's\noverall function was deteriorating.\n\nThe patient became volume overloaded during this hospital\ncourse with the normal saline boluses in the setting of\nunderlying congestive heart failure. He was seen by the\nPalliative Care team and at the time of discharge, the\nconsensus of the Medical Intensive Care Unit team was to\ndischarge the patient back to [**Location (un) 18437**] where he was to\nreceive palliative care.\n\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Poor.\n\nDISCHARGE STATUS:  To [**Location (un) 18437**].\n\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Coronary artery disease.\n\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\n\nRight arm ischemia secondary to graft occlusion.\n\nDementia.\n\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:\n1.

PLEASE REFER TO\nFINAL DISCHARGE SUMMARY FOR DETAILS OF FULL COURSE.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Baby Girl [**Known lastname **] is a 1170\ngram, 28 and 6/7 weeks gestation infant, Twin I, born to a 30\nyear old gravida I, para 0, now II, mother by cesarean\nsection for progression of preterm labor with known\nhydrocephalus in Twin II.  Prenatal screens were significant\nfor blood type O positive, antibody negative, rubella immune,\nRPR nonreactive, hepatitis B surface antigen negative, and\nGBS status unknown.  Pregnancy was complicated by IVF twins\nwith cervical shortening, on bedrest since [**2147-8-11**],\nsubchorionic hemorrhage in Twin I, and two vessel umbilical\ncord with ventriculomegaly in Twin II.  Amniocentesis was\ndeclined.  Betamethasone was administered on the date of\ndelivery.  Rupture of membranes was at delivery with clear\namniotic fluid.  There was no maternal fever.  At delivery,\nblow by oxygen followed by facial continuous positive airway\npressure and some positive pressure ventilation was required.\nThe heart rate was well maintained throughout.  Apgar was\neight at one minute and nine at five minutes of life.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, birth weight was 1170\ngrams, which is 25th to 50th percentile, length was 36.5\ncentimeters, which is 25th to 50th percentile and head\ncircumference was 26.5 centimeters, which is 25th to 50th\npercentile.  In general, Baby Girl [**Known lastname **] number one was a\nwell appearing female with an examination consistent with her\ngestational age.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat\nexamination revealed anterior fontanelle that was soft and\nflat, nondysmorphic facies, intact palate and nasal prong\ncontinuous positive airway pressure in place.  Her chest had\nmild intercostal retractions with good breath sounds\nbilaterally and a few crackles.  Her heart was regular rate\nand rhythm with normal femoral pulses, no murmur and good\nperfusion.  Her abdomen was soft, nondistended, with a three\nvessel umbilical cord, no masses, faint bowel sounds, and no\norganomegaly.  Her genitourinary examination revealed a\nnormal preterm female with a patent anus.  Her neurologic\nexamination was appropriate for her gestational age.  Her\nhips were stable.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  At the time of this interim dictation:\n\nRespiratory:  Baby Girl [**Known lastname **], number one, initially\nrequired continuous positive airway pressure of six\ncentimeters in room air.  She was able to wean off continuous\npositive airway pressure to room air over the first 48 hours\nof life.  She was restarted on continuous positive airway\npressure on day of life eight for increasing apnea and\nbradycardia spells.  By day of life twelve, she had\ndramatically improved and was placed back in room air, where\nshe has remained since that time.  Baby Girl [**Known lastname **] number\none has suffered from significant apnea of prematurity.  She\nwas started on caffeine and it has been advanced starting her\ncourse to the present dose of 10 mg/kg/day.  She is currently\nhaving two to four apnea and bradycardia spells per day.\n\nCardiovascular:  Baby Girl [**Known lastname **] number one has been\nhemodynamically stable throughout her hospital course.  She\nhas had normal blood pressure and perfusion.  On day of life\ntwelve, a new loud murmur was noted.  Echocardiogram on\n[**2147-10-2**], revealed a small patent ductus arteriosus with a\npeak predicted pressure drop of 60 to 65 mmHg.  In light of\nher stable clinical status at that time in room air on full\nfeeds with no palmar pulses and a large gradient across the\nduct, it was elected to follow the patent ductus arteriosus\nrather than treat it.  At the time of this dictation, she\npersists in having a loud murmur but no hemodynamic\ninstability.  The plan is to continue to follow her with\nlikely an echocardiogram prior to discharge.  There was\ndiscussion with the parents about potential need for\ntreatment of this if it is not closed by the time she is a\ntoddler.  At that time, it could be essentially closed\nthrough a catheterization procedure.  She has no other\nstructural heart abnormalities.\n\nFluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  Initially, Baby Girl\n[**Known lastname **] number one was held NPO on starter PN and D10W at 100\ncc/kg/day.  Enteral feeds were begun on day of life one and\nwere advanced to full feeds by day of life nine.  Her\ncalories were subsequently advanced to her present level of\nbreast milk 30 plus ProMod at 150 cc/kg/day.  Currently all\nher feedings are NG.  She is voiding and stooling normally.\nHer electrolytes have been stable throughout her\nhospitalization.\n\nHematology:  Initial hematocrit was 45.8 percent with\nplatelet count of 235,000.  Once she reached full feeds, she\nwas started on Vitamin E and iron supplementation.  Her most\nrecent hematocrit is 31.0 percent on [**2147-10-13**].  Baby Girl\n[**Known lastname **] number one did have hyperbilirubinemia for which she\nwas treated with phototherapy intermittently over her first\nweek of life.  Her peak bilirubin was 4.9 on day of life five\nand her most recent rebound bilirubin was 3.5 on day of life\ntwelve.\n\nInfectious disease:  In light of her prematurity and unknown\nGBS status, Baby Girl [**Known lastname **] number one had a complete blood\ncount and blood culture sent on admission and Ampicillin and\nGentamicin were begun.  Her initial white blood cell count\nwas 17.6 with 61 percent polys, 6 percent bands and 27\npercent lymphocytes.  Her cultures were negative at 48 hours\nand antibiotics were discontinued.  On day of life six, in\nlight of increasing clusters of apnea and bradycardia events,\na repeat complete blood count and blood culture were sent.\nThis was also reassuring but she received another brief\ncourse of Vancomycin and Gentamicin in light of persistent\nspells.  Those were discontinued after 48 hours when her\ncultures were again negative.  On [**2147-10-13**], she had\ntemperature to 101.0.  This was thought possibly to be\nenvironmental, as her examination was completely reassuring\nat the time, but a complete blood count and blood culture\nwere sent and she was restarted on Vancomycin and Gentamicin.\nComplete blood count revealed a white blood cell count of\n23.3 with 42 percent polys and 8 percent bands.  Culture is\npending at the time of this dictation.\n\nNeurology:  Initial screening head ultrasound was performed\non day of life four and was normal.  She should have a repeat\nhead ultrasound on day of life thirty.\n\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Prematurity at 28 and 6/7 weeks\ngestation.\n\nSmall patent ductus arteriosus.\n\nRespiratory distress syndrome, resolved.\n\nHyperbilirubinemia, resolved.\n\nImmature feeding.\n\nSuspected sepsis, ruled out.\n\n\n\n\n\nReviewed By:  [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 53043**], [**MD Number(1) 53044**]\nDictated By:[**Doctor Last Name 56737**]\nMEDQUIST36\nD:  [**2147-10-13**] 20:43:35\nT:  [**2147-10-14**] 13:44:31\nJob#:  [**Job Number 56738**]\n"}

The patient reported the\nonset of a gradual right-sided back pain that radiates to her\nlateral hip and down her anterior thigh to just below the knee.\nShe denied any weakness, numbness or saddle anesthesia. She went\nto an urgent care clinic approximately one week ago for dysuria\nand was started on Bactrim for a UTI. The patient stated that\nshe did not take any of the Bactrim. During that visit she was\nalso referred to a spine specialist who ordered an lumbar MRI\nthat was performed the day prior to admission and demonstrated a\nlarge midline lumbar mass centered around L3. On presentation,\nthe patient acknowledged a lesion on her left breast that had\nbeen present for at least six months. She further reported\nintermittent fevers as well as an unintentional weight loss of\napproximately 5 pounds over the last two months. ROS was\notherwise negative.\n.\nIn ED VS were T:98.9, HR:98, BP:115/61, RR:18, SO2:98%. The\npatient was started on Ciprofloxacin IV for her UTI.

There is\ngreater than 50% effacement of the canal at the L3 level.\n4. Additional areas of heterogeneity are noted throughout the\nthoracic spine. These findings are better evaluated on the\ncomparison MR of the thoracic spine, which does demonstrate\nevidence of metastatic disease throughout these levels.\n.\nECG ([**11-27**]): Normal sinus rhythm.

Necrotic Breast Mass and Lumbar Mass: Patient reported\nappearance of left breast mass approximately six months prior to\npresentation with development of low back pain approximately\nfour months later (two months prior to presentation). Patient's\nlast mammogram was seven years ago with little contact with the\nmedical community in the interim. Patient's presenting complaint\nwas low back pain. Examination revealed a large necrotic left\nbreast mass with left axillary lymphadenopathy, a large midline\nlumbar mass and some proximal lower extremity weakness, left\ngreater than right, but no other significant neurological\ndeficits. Spine MRI revealed bony metastasis in T4, T5 and T6\nvertebral bodies as well as in T10 vertebra but no pathologic\nfracture, epidural mass or spinal cord compression. CT torso\nrevealed diffusely metastatic disease involving the liver and\nlungs, thoracic spine metastases as reported in the MRI\nfindings, as well as multiple other osseous metastases including\na large soft tissue mass involving the posterior elements of L2\nto L5 and greater than 50% effacement of the spinal canal. A\nleft breast core needle biopsy revealed a grade 3 invasive\nductal carcinoma that was ER/PR +. Radiation oncology and\nMedical Oncology were contact[**Name (NI) **] the evening of admission.\nSteroids were initiated the night of admission to prevent\nadvancement of the spinal disease. The patient was given a TLSO\nbrace for comfort. Lupron was given for ovarian suppression once\nreceptor studies were reported. Patient went to the OR on [**12-2**]\nfor spinal stabilization and on [**12-3**] for spinal mass debulking.\nThe patient initially had a Wound vac in place but was removed\nseveral days prior to dishcarge. At discharge the wound appeared\nto be healing well. The patient was discharged to a\nrehabilitation facility to recover from her surgery prior to\ninitiation of chemotherapy and radiation.\n.\n2. Presumed Pyelonephritis: Patient presented to urgent care\nclinic one week prior to presentation at [**Hospital1 18**] for symptoms\nconsistent with cystitis. Patient was prescribed Bactrim but\nonly completed a partial course. On presentation to [**Hospital1 18**] the\npatient reported recent fevers to 101.5F, shaking chills,\nnausea, and flank pain (which was impossible to differentiate\nfrom pain due to her metastatic disease). Patient had\nleukocytosis on presentation. Blood cultures were taken and were\nnegative. Repeat UA and urine culture were negative. Despite the\nnegative urine studies, the patient was started on Ciprofloxacin\nIV (Ceftriaxone was not given as patient reported penicillin\nallergy) for a total of a 10-day course as clinical suspicion\nfor possible pyelonephritis was sufficiently high. The patient\nwas transitioned to Ciprofloxacin PO after clinical improvement\nwas observed for approximately 48 hours. The patient ultimately\ncompleted 9 days of antibiotics. One dose was missed as the\npatient was moved between services. A repeat urinalysis was\nperformed and showed no evidence of active infection so no\nfurther antibiotics were given.\n.\n3. Hypercalcemia: Serum Ca 15.2 on admission. Bony metastases\nwere deemed the most likely etiology. Normal saline was started\nat 250 cc/hr to maintain a urine output of 100-150 cc/hr.\nCalcitonin and Pamidronate were given for osteoclast inhibition.\nSerum Ca subsequently decreased to between 9 and 10. Lasix were\ngiven when the patient subsequently developed hypoxia with CXR\nevidence of pulmonary edema. The patient's hypoxia resolved. The\npatient continued to receive IVF as needed with Lasix to prevent\nrecurrence of volume overload. At discharge, the patient's\ncorrected calcium was approximately 10.8. The Oncology service\nstated that they would give the patient her next dose of\nPamidronate in clinic at her appointment on [**12-22**].\n.\n4. Anemia: Hematocrit on admission was 35.9 with an unknown\nbaseline. Anemia of chronic disease (AICD) was considered the\nmost likely etiology given the patient's underlying disease\nprocess. Reticulocyte count 2.2 with reticulocyte index of 0.95,\nindicating an [**Last Name 88383**] problem consistent with her\ninflammatory state. DIC labs indicated no DIC with a fibrinogen\nof 485 and FDP of 0-10. Calculated TIBC was 229, ferritin was\n879, and transferrin was 176, all consistent with anemia of\nchronic disease. The patient did ultimately require transfusion\nof 5 units of packed red blood cells for surgery-related losses.\nAfter transfer back to the medicine floor, the patient's\nhematocrit remained stable at approximately 35 throughout the\nremainder of her hospitalization.\n.\n5. Pain control: On admission, patient complained of significant\nback pain and sharp, shooting pain down her right leg with\nmovement. She was first treated with 2-4 mg IV Dilaudid, Q3 PRN.\nPatient still felt pain was substantial. On [**11-27**], pain\nmedication was changed to MS Contin 30 mg PO Q8H, with IV 1-2 mg\nDilaudid for breakthrough pain. On [**11-29**], morphine afternoon dose\nincreased to 45 mg TID. MS Contin was again increased on [**12-7**]\nto 60 mg PO Q8H, with breakthrough IV Dilaudid. On [**12-8**], the\npatient required 6 mg of IV Dilaudid for breakthrough pain. Her\nMS Contin was increased to 90 mg Q8H on [**12-9**].\n.\n6. Constipation: On admission, patient had not had a bowel\nmovement in approx 10 days. Likely etiology of patient's\nconstipation presumed to be her hypercalcemia. After\nhypercalcemia levels were corrected, patient was passing gas,\nbut still not moving bowels. CT scan of abdomen and pelvis\nshowed no evidence of compressive obstruction. The patient's\nbowel regimen was adjusted as needed and the patient received\nintermittent enemas for additional relief. As it seemed likely\nthat much of the patient's ongoing constipation was likely\nopioid-related the patient received one dose of\nMethylnaltrexone.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nMedications:\n1.

No evidence of porcelain aorta, aneurysm or\ndissection. 2. Severe aortic valve calcification and markedly\ndecrease aortic valve excursion with an orifice area of 68.3mm2\nat systole. Pre-operative transcatheter aortic valve replacement\nmeasurements are described in this report. 2. Moderate bilateral\npleural effusion and interstitial as well as alveolar pulmonary\nedema and cardiomegaly consistent with CHF. Pulmonary arterial\nenlargement may be a secondary phenomenon. 3. Subcentimeter\nhypodense lesion in the liver is too small to characterize but\nlikely consistent with a cyst.\n\n[**2168-3-9**] Echo: PRE-CPB: The left atrium is markedly dilated. No\nthrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage. No atrial septal\ndefect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall\nthicknesses are normal while the left ventricular cavity is\nseverely dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function is\nseverely depressed, estimated EF is 20%. The right ventricular\ncavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility.\nThere are complex (mobile) atheroma in the ascending aorta. The\ndescending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple\natheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. No thoracic aortic\ndissection is seen. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The\naortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. Only the\nnon-coronary cusp appears to be mobile. There is severe aortic\nstenosis. Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral\nvalve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is decreased length\nof coaptation zone. Mild to moderate ([**2-14**]+) central mitral\nregurgitation is seen. This most likely represents functional MR\ndue to dilated LV. Pulmonary vein flow Doppler shows systolic\nblunting, consistent with elevated [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 1934**]. There is a very\nsmall pericardial effusion. There is a moderate left pleural\neffusion. POST-CPB: A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is\npresent. The aortic valve prosthesis is well seated and the\nleaflets appear to move normally. There is a small intravalvular\nleak seen in the area of the anatomic right coronary cusp. This\njet is centrally directed and is no longer seen on\nre-examination fifteen minutes later by a second examiner. The\npeak gradient across the aortic valve prosthesisis 34mmHg and\nthe mean gradient is 16mmHg with a CO of 6. A tube graft is seen\nin the ascending aorta. With a smaller LV chamber size, the\nwalls appear mild-to-moderately hypertrophied. The LV systolic\nfunction continues to be severely depressed, now with regional\nhypokinesis more notable in the inferior wall. The estimated EF\nis 25%. The MR has improved to mild. The TR is also now mild.\nThere is no evidence of aortic dissection. Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was\nnotified in person of the results at the time of study.\n\n[**2168-3-10**] Head CT: There is no evidence of acute intracranial\nhemorrhage, mass effect, or large territorial infarction. Dense\nvascular atherosclerotic calcifications. Bilateral mucosal\nthickening at the maxillary sinuses and pool of secretions is\nnoted at the nasopharynx, the patient is intubated.\n\n[**2168-3-18**] CXR: CHEST (PA \u0026 LAT) 1. Stable right pleural effusion\nand improvement in left pleural fluid collection, now containing\nseveral lucencies likely representing locules of air.\n2. Interval improved aeration within the left lung with residual\npatchy\nopacifications in the left upper lobe and right lung.\n\n[**2168-3-19**] Echo: read pend\n\n\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nAs mentioned in the HPI, Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 85253**] is an 84 year-old male with\nCoronary artery disease and aortic stenosis who was admitted\n[**2168-2-25**] to [**Hospital **] Hospital with chest and back pain, shortness of\nbreath, and concern for NSTEMI and decompensated heart failure.\nEKG showed ST depression in V3-V6, II-aVF, and troponin\nelevation; had subsequent pulmonary edema and diuresed at OSH.\nPatient has known three vessel coronary disease and had cath\n[**2-26**], without intervention, which showed LAD 70% proximal\nstenosis, major diag with severe irregular 90% proximal\nstenosis, 60-80% stenosis of Ramus, LCx with 100% proximal\nocclusion, and RCA with 95% hazy proximal stenosis followed by\n60-80% disease in proximal-mid segment. He was transferred to\n[**Hospital1 18**] for surgical intervention. Upon admission he was medically\nmanaged and underwent extensive pre-operative work-up. This\nincluded echo, carotid U/S, CTA of Torso and dental clearance.\nPre-op he required significant diuresis for pulmonary edema and\nacute on chronic systolic heart failure. He initially\nsymptomatically improved; however, he became difficult to\ndiurese given acute renal insufficiency. As above, repeat echo\nshowed worsened EF of 30%, dilated and hypertrophied left\nventricle with moderate to severe global systolic dysfunction;\nmoderate functional mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, and\nmoderate to severe pulmonary hypertension. He was placed on a\nLasix gtt, but his creatinine bumped. On evening of [**3-4**], he had\nflash pulmonary edema with desats to 80s on 6L. He was given\nLasix boluses, and his O2 sats improved. He continued to be\nfluid overloaded and was placed on gentle Lasix gtt. On the\nevening of [**2168-2-29**] he had large bloody bowel movement. GI was\nconsulted and thought it was most likely secondary to\nhemorrhoids. He was treated with hydrocortisone suppositories\nfor 1 week. He had no more episodes of bleeding with several\nguaiac negative stools. On [**2168-3-9**] he was brought to the\noperating room where he underwent coronary artery bypass x 4,\naortic valve replacement and replacement of his ascending aorta.\nPlease see operative report for surgical details. He was\ntransferred to the CVICU in fair condition with an open, packed\nchest due to significant bleeding intraoperatively, and on\ntitrated epinephrine, milrinone, Levophed, vasopressin, and\npropofol drips. The following morning he returned to the\noperating room for chest closure. Inotropic and pressor support\nwas weaned slowly over the next few days. On [**3-10**] he was noted\nto have possible seizures and neurology was consulted. He\nunderwent head CT, which was negative, although neurology felt\nhe sustained some sort of embolic infarct. He remained stable\nover next several days with no further episodes and was weaned\nfrom sedation on post-op day three, awoke neurologically intact\nand extubated. Also on this day chest tubes were removed with\nsubsequent chest x-ray's revealing bilateral pneumothoraces.\nDuring the remainder of his hospital course these pneumothoraces\nsignificantly decreased in size. Amiodarone was resumed and was\neventually placed on Heparin with transition to Coumadin for\natrial fibrillation. Beta blockers and diuretics were initiated\nand he was gently diuresed towards his pre-op weight. Epicardial\npacing wires were removed per protocol. On post-op day five he\nwas transferred to the telemetry floor for further care. On this\nday his INR was found to be 8.3, with repeat INR of 9.1. He\nreceived FFP and Vitamin K. Initially INR trended down following\ntreatment with FFP and Vitamin K to 2.7 but the following day\nwas found to have an INR of 5.5. Vitamin K was given once and\nINR came down to 2.0 the following day. Coumadin was restarted\nat 0.5mg on [**3-17**]. INR was 2.3 on [**3-18**] and 2.1 on [**3-19**], the day of\ndischarge. He should receive 1mg of Coumadin on [**3-19**] and receive\nclose monitoring of INR daily. Echo performed on day of\ndischarge to evaluate EF, results pending. The patient was\nevaluated by the physical therapy service during this admission\nfor assistance with strength and mobility.  By the time of\ndischarge on POD 10 the patient needed assistance with\nambulating, the wound was healing and pain was controlled\nwithout need for oral analgesics.  The patient was discharged in\ngood condition with appropriate follow up instructions.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nMEDICATIONS AT HOME:\nASA 81mg PO daily\nNorvasc 5mg PO daily\nLipitor 40mg PO daily\nAtenolol 25mg PO daily\nFosinopril 20mg daily\n.\nMEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:\nLopressor 25mgpo q6hrs\nLipitor 80mg qday\nSLNTG 0.4mg q5 mins prn\nMorphine 1-2mg IV q1-2hrs prn\nLasix 20mg IV q24hrs\nRocephin 1g IV q24hrs\nZithromax 500mg IV q24hrs\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1. atorvastatin 80 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY\n(Daily).\nDisp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*2*\n2. aspirin 81 mg Tablet, Chewable Sig: One (1) Tablet, Chewable\nPO DAILY (Daily).\n3. docusate sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2\ntimes a day).\nDisp:*60 Capsule(s)* Refills:*2*\n4. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a\nday) as needed for constipation.\nDisp:*15 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*\n5. benzonatate 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO TID (3\ntimes a day).\nDisp:*90 Capsule(s)* Refills:*2*\n6. pantoprazole 40 mg Tablet, Delayed Release (E.C.)

Stable chest x-ray exam.\n.\nECHO: The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall\nthickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are\nnormal (LVEF 60%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall\nmotion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly\nthickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No masses or\nvegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully\nexcluded due to suboptimal image quality. The mitral valve\nleaflets are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve\nprolapse. No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve,\nbut cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.\nMild to moderate ([**2-14**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is\nmild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. No masses or\nvegetations are seen on the pulmonic valve, but cannot be fully\nexcluded due to suboptimal image quality. There is no\npericardial effusion.\n.\nCompared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)\nof [**2172-2-21**], the findings are similar but the technically\nsuboptimal nature of both studies precludes definitive\ncomparison.\n.\nIMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. No vegetations seen\n.\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nThe patient is a 65 year-old female with hx of stage [**Doctor First Name **]\nsquamous cell cervical cancer, status post combined\nchemoradiation with bilateral nephrostomy tubes admitted with\nurosepsis.\n.\n# Urosepsis: Initially admitted to ICU, requiring pressors given\nhypotension in setting of sepsis. Urinary source believed to be\nmost likely given positive UA and bilateral CVA tenderness. CXR\nand c.diff returned negative. The patient was started on\nvancomycin and cefepime empirically given recent staph aureus\nUTIs and the possiblity of resistant organisms. The patient was\nalso given two days of stress dose hydrocortisone. The patient's\nsymptoms resolved with broad-spectrum antibiotics, and she was\nweaned off pressors and transferred to the floor.\n.\nThe patient's urine culture grew methicillin-resistant staph\naureus and enterococcus; her blood culture grew\nmethicillin-resistant staph aureus. Urology was consulted during\nher stay with Dr.[**Doctor Last Name **] recommendation to keep tubes in place\nuntil outpatient follow-up. ECHO returned negative for\nvegetation. ID service was consulted. Her cefepime was\ndiscontinued. The patient will continue a two week course of\nvancomycin (through [**6-3**], two weeks through last positive blood\nculture). Prior to discharge, the patient's vanco level was\ngreater than 30. Her dose was adjusted, and she was instructed\nto skip a dose when returning home (trough to be measured by\nVNA).  Upon completetion of the vancomycin, she will initiate\ntreatment with Macrobid, which she will continue for one week\nbeyond removal of nephrostomy tubes. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1075**] of ID will oversee\nthis transition.\n.\nPrior plan was to have left nephrostogram on [**2173-5-28**] with\npotential removal of tube.\n.\n# Status-post fall: No LOC or head strike, likely in setting of\nhypotension and weakness related to sepsis. Only trauma appears\nto be bilateral knees and perhaps R arm where patient caught\nherself while falling. She was continued on home dose oxycodone\n5mg Q6hrs PRN pain for her L back/CVA tenderness.\n.\n# Anemia: No evidence of bleeding on exam/history. Normal T.bili\nnot indicative of hemolysis. Remained stable after 2 units of\nPRBCs.\n.\n# Elevated INR: Elevated at 1.6 at time of ICU arrival. No\nevidence of DIC on lab work-up. Mild INR elevation may also be\ndue to recent antibiotic use wiping out gut flora and\ninhibititon of vit K utilization. Started on 3 day course of Vit\nK. INR trended to 1.1 at the time of discharge.\n.\n# Panhypopituitary: Secondary to surgery many years ago. On\nsynthroid and prednisone as outpatient for years. Given 2 days\nof stress dose steroids, and then re-started on home prednisone\n5 mg po daily dose 04/07. She was continued on home synthroid at\nhome dose 125mcg daily.\n.\n# Cervical cancer: S/p treatment with chemo and radiation. Her\nlast chemotherapy was on [**2173-4-12**], and her last radiation\ntreatment on [**2173-4-28**].\n.\n# Transitions of Care:\n- VNA will check weekly labs prior to follow-up with ID (CBC,\nchem7, vanco trough)\n- ID will oversee transition to macrobid following vancomycin\ncompletion\n- Urology will evaluate/manage timing or nephrostomy tube\nremoval\n\nMedications on Admission:\nBACTRIM DS [**Hospital1 **] for 14 days started on [**2173-5-17**]\nLEVOTHYROXINE - 125 mcg Tablet - one Tablet(s) by mouth daily\nLIDOCAINE-PRILOCAINE - 2.5 %-2.5 % Cream - 2.5grams topically to\nPORT site as directed as needed for prior to accessing PORT\nOLANZAPINE [ZYPREXA] - 2.5 mg Tablet - [**2-14**] Tablet(s) by mouth Q6\nhours and QHS as needed for anxiety, insomnia\nOXYCODONE - 5 mg Tablet - [**2-14**] Tablet(s) by mouth every four (4)\nhours as needed for Pain\nPOLYETHYLENE GLYCOL 3350 - 17 gram/dose Powder - 1 packet by\nmouth daily as needed for constipation\nPREDNISONE - 5 mg Tablet - one Tablet by mouth daily\nPROCHLORPERAZINE MALEATE - (Prescribed by Other Provider) - 10\nmg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth every 6 hours as needed for for\nnausea\nACETAMINOPHEN - (Prescribed by Other Provider) - 325 mg Tablet -\n1- 2 Tablet(s) by mouth every six (6) hours as needed for\nPain/Fever\nCALCIUM CARBONATE - (Prescribed by Other Provider) - 200 mg (500\nmg) Tablet, Chewable - 2 Tablet(s) by mouth twice a day\nDOCUSATE SODIUM - (Prescribed by Other Provider) - 100 mg\nCapsule - 1 Capsule(s) by mouth twice a day\nMAGNESIUM OXIDE - (Prescribed by Other Provider; Dose adjustment\n- no new Rx) - 400 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth three times\na day\nOMEPRAZOLE MAGNESIUM [PRILOSEC OTC] - (OTC) - 20 mg Tablet,\nDelayed Release (E.C.) - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth daily\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1. levothyroxine 125 mcg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY\n(Daily).\n2. lidocaine-prilocaine 2.5-2.5 % Cream Sig: One (1) appl\nTopical once a day: topically to\nPORT site as directed as needed for prior to accessing PORT.\n3. olanzapine 2.5 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO every six (6)\nhours as needed for anxiety.\n4. oxycodone 5 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q4H (every 4 hours)\nas needed for pain.\n5. polyethylene glycol 3350 17 gram/dose Powder Sig: One (1)\npacket PO DAILY (Daily) as needed for constipation.\n6. prednisone 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).\n\n7. prochlorperazine maleate 10 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO\nQ6H (every 6 hours) as needed for nausea.\n8. acetaminophen 325 mg Tablet Sig: 1-2 Tablets PO Q6H (every 6\nhours) as needed for pain/fever.\n9. calcium carbonate 200 mg (500 mg) Tablet, Chewable Sig: Two\n(2) Tablet, Chewable PO twice a day.\n10. docusate sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID\n(2 times a day) as needed for constipation.\n11. omeprazole 20 mg Capsule, Delayed Release(E.C.)

The door to his house was reportedly open and his\nneighbors called the police when patient was apparently\nstruggling to get up and muttering about shoveling his walkway.\nHis sister-in-law has limited information about his\npresentation, though reports the neighbors had seen patient\napparently of normal mental status and working in his yard\nearlier in day on [**2117-12-27**] prior this incident.\n.\nUpon presentation to [**Hospital3 2737**], patient was hypotensive\nwith SBP in 90s and temperature of 96 at arrival. Was initially\nin [**Last Name (un) **] with Cr of 1.4, though marginally improved to 1.1 prior\nto transfer.  Mr. [**Known lastname 59243**] was noted to have a HCT elevation to\n55.2 at [**Hospital1 **] along with leukocytosis of 22 with 25% bands.\nHis lactate was initially 5.2, though fell to 4.2 prior to\ntransfer following 3L IVF.

Left ventricular wall\nthicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is\nmoderately dilated. There is severe global left ventricular\nhypokinesis (LVEF = 15-20%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an\nincreased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP\u003e18mmHg). There\nis no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is\ndilated with depressed free wall contractility. The aortic valve\nleaflets are mildly thickened.  No masses or vegetations are\nseen on the aortic valve. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly\nthickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or\nvegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral\nregurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly\nthickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.\nThere is no pericardial effusion.\n\nIMPRESSION: Moderately dilated and severely hypokinetic left\nventricle. Dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle. Diastolic\ndysfunction with elevated filling pressures. Mild mitral\nregurgitation. At least mild pulmonary artery systolic\nhypertension. No vegetation or abscess seen.\n\nABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND [**12-29**]:  1. Abdominal ascites and right\npleural effusion.  1. Slightly thickened gallbladder wall with\nbiliary sludge. Given patient's ICU stay and known\nhypoalbuminemia, this is a nonspecific finding, especially in\nthe absence of other features for cholecystitis.\n\nCTA [**12-29**]:  IMPRESSION:\n1. Moderate ascites within abdomen and pelvis.\n2. Patent lower limb arteries above the level of the ankle. The\nright\nposterior tibial artery is occluded beyond the level of the\nankle. The left dorsalis pedis artery is occluded.\n\nTEE [**12-30**]:  Trace aortic regurgitation with mild aortic leaflet\nthickening, but no 2D echocardiographic evidence for\nendocarditis. Biventricular systolic dysfunction.\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nThis is a 61-year-old man with no known PMHx, presented to\n[**Hospital3 2737**] on [**2117-12-27**] via EMS after being found down,\nlethargic, and minimally responsive on the floor of his home.\n.\n#. Hypotension:  Likely multifactorial from distributive shock\nand cardiogenic shock.  Blood cultures from [**Hospital3 **]\nshowed 4/4 bottles positive for staph aureus.  Patient was\ninitially treated with Vancomycin, and then switched to\nNafcillin when organism discovered to be MSSA.  He was also\nbroadly covered with cefepime (eventually switched to cipro) and\nflagyl.  Source for infection was never definitively identified,\nthough most likely portal of entry was through grossly necrotic\nfoot ulcers.  A TEE was done, which was did not show any\nvegetations to suggest endocarditis (given staph bacteremia).\n[**Hospital **] hospital course, patient continued to spike fevers and\nrequire vasopressors despite adequate fluid rescuscitation.\nCardiogenic shock is also likely in the setting of an EF of\n15-20%.  According to patient's sisters, he had not seen a\ndoctor in many years, and his baseline cardiac status is\nunknown.  He was ruled out for a myocardial infarction.  Unknown\netiology of cardiac failure however, patient undoubtedly had\ncoronary artery disease with a hemaglobin A1C of 11.\n.\n#. Respiratory Status:  Patient was initially intubated at\n[**Hospital3 **] to ensure a safe transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].  He was\nnever in acute respiratory failure.  The team considered\nextubation however, it was felt that patient's overall picture\nwas too tenuous, and his mental status was unknown.  He\ncontinued to be intubated throughout his hospital stay.\n.\n#. Jaundice:  Patient LFTs and bilirubin continued to rise\nthroughout admission.  A right upper quadrant ultrasound was\nperformed, which showed sludge but no evidence of cholecystitis.\n Hepatology seriologies were negative.  LFTs continued to rise\nin the setting of sepsis and resultant liver failure.\n.\n#. Coagulopathy:  Patient presented to [**Hospital3 **] with an\nINR of 5 and platelets of 69.  Throughout his stay in the [**Name (NI) 153**],\nPT/PTT and INR continued to be elevated and platelets decreased.\n Unclear etiology of coagulopathy but again, most likely sepsis\nleading to synthetic failure and poor platelet function.\n.\n#. Dry gangrene:  Patient with unknown chronicity of his\nbilateral foot ulcers, though presents with necrotic lesions on\nleft and right feet.  Vascular surgery was consulted who\nrecommended bilateral amputations.  However, patient's family\nstated that he would not have wanted to live without his feet.\nAs such, amputation was deferred.  A CTA of legs was performed,\nwhich showed patent vessels up until his ankles.\n.\n#. [**Last Name (un) **]:  Patient with unknown baseline Cr, though presented with\ncreatinine of 1.4 in setting of BUN of 67.  Taking into account\nentire clinical picture, it is reasonable to assume that acute\nkidney injury is a combination of pre-renal azotemia and ATN\nfrom poor perfusion.  Creatinine and BUN continued to rise\nthroughout hospital course.\n.\nGOALS OF CARE:  Extensive discussions were held with patient's\nfamily, and gravity of situation was discussed.  Family\nunderstood that maximal medical efforts had been attempted, but\npatient's condition continued to deteriorate.  The decision was\nmade to make patient DNR, and goals of care became patient\ncomfort.  Pressors were discontinued, and patient eventually\npassed at 1710 on [**2118-1-1**].\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nTRANSFER MEDICATIONS:\n1) Primaxin 500mg IV Q8H (last dose charted at 1600 [**12-28**])\n2) Vancomycin 1G IV Q12H (last dose charted at 0900 [**12-28**])\n3) Norepinephrine drip 10 mcg/hr\n4) Insulin sliding scale\n5) NS 250 mL/hr for 3 L then 150 mL/hr continuous\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\nPatient expired.\n\nDischarge Disposition:\nExpired\n\nDischarge Diagnosis:\nPatient expired.\n\nDischarge Condition:\nPatient expired.\n\nDischarge Instructions:\nPatient expired.\n\nFollowup Instructions:\nPatient expired.\n\n\n"}

The liver is\nunremarkable. The patient is status post cholecystectomy. The\npancreas is boggy in appearance, and there is decrease in the\nexpected contrast enhancement. There is a significant amount of\nperipancreatic fluid. The spleen is normal in appearance;\nhowever, the splenic vein appears occluded. The adrenal glands\nand kidneys are unremarkable. There is a low attenuation focus,\nwhich measures 7 x 3.6 cm with a thin-walled, which likely\nrepresents a pseudocyst either within the lesser sac or within\nthe gastric wall. In either case, it is exerting external\ncompression on the stomach. A nasointestinal feeding tube is\nidentified with the tip in the third portion of the duodenum.\nThere is a significant amount of inflammatory exudate and fluid\ntracking along the paracolic gutters. There is thickening of the\nwall of the upper portions of the upper right and left and\ntransverse colon. Multiple small mesenteric lymph nodes are\nidentified.\n\nCT PELVIS: Foley catheter and air are noted in the bladder. The\nprostate, seminal vesicles and rectum are unremarkable. There\nare scattered sigmoid diverticula. A rectal tube is noted. There\nis a moderate amount of fluid in the pelvis. There is no pelvic\nor inguinal lymphadenopathy. Diffuse cutaneous stranding is\nnoted.\n\nBONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous\nlesions.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Large boggy pancreas with significant associated inflammatory\nexudate consistent with pancreatitis. Decreased perfusion of the\npancreas is worrisome for necrosis. In addition, there is a\nlarge fluid collection with apparent thin wall consistent with a\npseudocyst either gated in the lesser sac or within the gastric\nwall. This exerts mass effect on the stomach.\n2. Splenic vein occlusion.\n3. Wall thickening of the transverse colon and upper portions of\nthe right and left colon consistent with colitis secondary to\nperipancreatic inflammation.\n4. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions and bilateral lower lobe\natelectasis.\n5. Moderate amount of free fluid in the abdomen.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nThe patient is a 37 year old male who was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on\n[**2158-5-10**] with acute pancreatitis.  He was admitted to the ICU and\nreceived aggressive fluid resuscitation.  He was kept NPO.  An\nNG tube, Foley, A-line and CVL were placed.  A chest X-ray was\nunremarkable.  His creatinine was elevated at 3.7.  His WBC was\n16.  He had transaminitis (ALT 166, AST 260), his amylase was\n500 and his lactate was 3.5.  On HD 2, he was intubated.  His\nAST was 2064 and his ALT was 724.  His total bilirubin and\nalkaline phosphatase were normal.  He received Hydromorphone for\npain and Lorazepam for anxiety.  Imipenem was started\nempirically.  That night he required a phenylephrine drip for\nhypotension.  An OG tube was placed and bilious material\nreturned.  He had new left lower lobe atelectasis on CXR.  A RUQ\nultrasound was unremarkable for gallstones, but did show\nevidence of liver cirrhosis.  On HD 3, he was febrile to 101.\nHis WBC was down to 6.6.  His creatinine was down to 2.7.  His\nlactate was down to 1.7.  His ALT, AST, and amylase were\ntrending down.  A CXR showed improved pulmonary edema, however\nhe did have bilateral effusions.  Tube feeds were started via\nhis Dobbhoff.  Fentanyl and midazolam were used for sedation.\nHis LFTs continued to trend down.  On HD 4, his Dobbhoff was\nplaced post-pyloric under fluoroscopy.  On HD 5, a CT scan\nshowed a large boggy pancreas with significant associated\ninflammatory exudate consistent with pancreatitis. Decreased\nperfusion of the pancreas was worrisome for necrosis. In\naddition, there was a large fluid collection with apparent thin\nwall consistent with a pseudocyst either gated in the lesser sac\nor within the gastric wall. Also, there was evidence of splenic\nvein occlusion.  In addition, there was wall thickening of the\ntransverse colon and upper portions of the right and left colon\nconsistent with colitis secondary to peripancreatic\ninflammation, and moderate bilateral pleural effusions and\nbilateral lower lobe atelectasis.  We decided that no\nintervention was necessary at this time, as there was no\nevidence of pancreatic necrosis. On HD 6, Lopressor was used as\nneeded for tachycardia.  His tube feeds were increased, but were\none half strength.  On HD 7, this patient was transferred to the\ngold surgery service under the care of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].\n\nThe patient remained intubated until HD 15. He was sedated on\nFentanyl and Versed. He was agitated at times requiring Haldol\nwith good effect. The patient was having difficulty weaning off\nthe vent and a Trach was discussed if unable to wean. HD 10  he\nspike to 104.4 and treated with Tylenol and cooling blankets.\nBlood cultures were negative. He continued on Imipenem and\nFluconazole. HD 11 he was tried on CPAP but desaturated and\nbecame tachypneic and had to be put on Assist-control on a rate.\nHe was opening eyes spontaneously, but unable to follow commands\nor track and was tachycardic when anxious.\n\nHD 15 he was extubated. Tube feedings were held due to abdominal\npain and then Dobbhoff tube feedings were restarted. He was\ntransferred to the floor on HD 18 where he progressed well. He\nbegan a regular diet and had no shortness of breath. He had a CT\nof his pancreas/splenic vein and was discharged home in good\ncondition.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nLopressor\nXanax\nCholestyramine\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.

He underwent\nthe procedure without incident, but 4 hrs post procedurally,\npatient experienced swelling of his uvula and had oropharyngeal\ndiscomfort. Patient's posterior oropharynx and uvula were\nnoticed to be markedly swollen, and he was given racemic\nepinephrine, IV methylprednisolone, diphenhydramine, and\nranitidine in the EP lab.  He had resolution of shortness of\nbreath and slight improvement of posterior throat and uvula\nswelling on arrival to the CCU, and was treated with prednisone\nand diphenhydramine in the CCU.  Allergy was consulted, and\nrecommended outpatient follow-up and instructed the patient to\navoid opiates, peanuts, latex prior to allergy testing during\nhis follow-up visit. Per Allergy attending, unclear etiology for\nanaphylaxis with no clear precipitating trigger (though possibly\n[**2-25**] medications used during EP procedure or latex).  Patient\nalso has never had swelling, hives, or respiratory distress in\nthe past and did not experience any swelling or hives during\nthis episode. (Patient had ingested peanut butter post\nprocedurally, but pt noted that he felt his uvula swollen prior\nto ingestion.)  The patient was monitored closely, and the\nswelling continued to improve overnight.  The patient was sent\nhome on a prednisone taper with an epi pen, and advised to buy\nOTC benadryl to keep in his house in the case of an allergic\nreaction.\n.\n# RHYTHM/PUMP: Patient underwent a scheduled AV nodal ablation\nin the EP lab prior to transfer to CCU for likely AVNRT and\nshortness of breath and palpitations while playing basketball.\nFollowing his ablation procedure, the patient did not have any\narrhytmias on telemetry in the CCU.  Patient did have heart rate\nin upper 40s to 60s, likely physiologic [**2-25**] athletic\nconditioning. Given echographic findings of mild RV dilation,\nthere was initial concern that these findings were related to\nthe patient's arrythmogenic events, or indicated an intracardiac\nshunt. However, CE-CMR was performed to confirm that there is no\nintra-cardiac shunt, and the changes are consistent with\nathlete's heart. The patient was discharged with EP follow up as\noutpatient, and may need further ablation in the future if\narrhythmias recur.  He was instructed not to exercise for one\nweek post procedurally.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nNone\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.

You were transferred to the intensive\ncare unit to monitor your breathing and ensure your allergic\nreaction responded to the medications you were given to treat\nthe reaction.  You responded well to the medications and the\nswelling improved, but you still had swelling of your uvula and\nthroat when you were discharged.  Therefore, you should have\nBenadryl at home to take if the swelling in your throat becomes\nworse or if you become short of breath or have swelling in other\nareas.\n.\nYou should avoid narcotic pain medications and peanuts (though\nit is unlikely you have an allergy to peanuts) and latex prior\nto your follow up with the allergist in the allergy clinic.\n\nNo changes were made to your medications.

RBBB. TWI III, AVF (new).\n\nRelevant Imaging:\n1)Cxray ([**11-16**]): Limited study.  No obvious pneumonia,\npneumothorax, or pleural effusion detected in these conditions.\nApical redistribution of pulmonary blood flow. A repeat chest\nradiograph in a true AP projection is recommended for better\ndelineation, as well as to better assess heart size.\n\n2)Lower extremity U/S ([**11-16**]): No evidence of bilateral lower\nextremity deep venous thrombosis.\n\n3)ECHO ([**11-17**]):The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left\nventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function\nare normal (LVEF\u003e55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is\nnormal. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Right\nventricular systolic function is normal. The aortic valve\nleaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not\npresent. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.\nNo aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are\nmoderately thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse.\nModerate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve\nleaflets are mildly thickened. Severe [4+] tricuspid\nregurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery\nsystolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.\n\n4)RUE U/S ([**11-20**]): Limited study of the right upper extremity,\nwithout intraluminal thrombus is identified. The right internal\njugular and medial right subclavian veins were not examined as\ndescribed.\n\n5)Cxray ([**11-23**]):There was considerable rotation of the patient\nto the right, thereby making difficult comparisons of heart size\nwith prior films. The left-sided pacemaker with its single\nventricular lead seems unchanged in position. There has been\ninterval placement of a right-sided PICC line, with its tip at\nthe level of the mid or central portion of the superior vena\ncava. Bibasilar small pleural effusions are present, left worse\nthan right.\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nMs. [**Known lastname 63845**] is a 80 yo female with a history of CRI, chronic\nAF on Coumadin, diastolic CHF who presents in ARF, bradycardia,\nhyperkalemia, uremic symptoms, and possible LE cellulitis.\nHyperkalemia resolved and renal failure improving slowly with\nIVFs. Had been 100% transvenous paced, now s/p permanent\npacemaker placement.\n\n1) Rhythm: Patient has history of Chronic AF and became\nbradycardic in the setting of severe renal failure and\nhyperkalemia. Patient was discharged on Atenolol on her last\nadmission, which is renally excreted, and became bradycardic as\nher creatinine increased. In the ED, she was given Atropine with\na minimal response and a temporary pacer was placed in the EP\nlab. Her anti-hypertensives, diuretics, and Coumadin were held.\nHer pacer rate was initially set at 60 but slowly increased to\n80, which she tolerated. Heparin gtt was started for\nanti-coagulation but was held because she had significant\nepistaxis and hematuria. She was followed closely by EP and a\npermanent single chamber pacemaker was placed with no\ncomplications. She was treated with 3 days of Vancomycin, per\nEP. She will need follow-up with EP and the device clinic. Would\nrecommend no atenolol given h/o renal dysfunction, instead give\nmetoprolol if requires restart of beta-blocker.\n\n2) Pump: Patient has EF \u003e55%, severe tricuspid regurgitation,\nlikely diastolic dysfunction. She takes Lasix and Spironolactone\nat home, both of which were stopped given her renal failure and\ndehydration. She is extremely edematous on exam but is likely\nintravascularly depleted given her elevated BUN and dry mucous\nmembranes on clinical exam. Patient was started on maintenance\nfluids several times during her hospital stay given her poor\nintake. She also required multiple fluid boluses to maintain her\nblood pressure. Would recommend to continue holding all\ndiuretics for now despite peripheral edema given intravascularly\ndeplete and extremely poor PO intake.\n\n3) Acute-on-chronic renal failure: Patient initially came in\nwith a creatinine of 4.4 and a potassium of 8.8, secondary to\ndecreased PO intake, nausea, vomiting, and diuretics. Baseline\ncreatinine is 1.6. Her BUN was elevated at 132 from dehydration.\nShe did not require dialysis. In the ED she was given Kayexalate\nand glucagon. She was followed closely by renal during her stay.\nHer creatinine slowly improved to 1.5 on discharge. Her\npotassium quickly resolved as well. Recommend IV NS 1L @ 75cc/hr\nqod while PO intake poor to maintain intravascular volume.\n\n4) Diabetes: Patient on Avandia and Glyburide at home. These\nwere stopped given her renal failure and she was placed on a\ninsulin sliding scale with sugars checked QID. Discontinued\nglyburide and avandia given h/o renal dysfunction, started on\nglipizide prior to discharge.\n\n5) Lower extremity edema: Patient presented with skin changes,\ninitially thought to be cellulitis. As her swelling improving it\nwas thought that she had extensive venous stasis instead. Daily\npressure dressings were done. The patient was started on\nVancomycin for presumed MRSA cellulitis but was d/c'ed given\nthat this was not the case. Completed 10 day course.\n\n6) Elevated INR: Patient initially presented with an INR 3.0 on\nadmission. Unlikely related to her dose of Coumadin. Secondary\nto poor PO intake. She was given several doses of Vitamin K to\ndecrease her INR in preparation for her pacemaker placement.\n\n7) Hyperlipidemia: Continue outpatient regimen of Lipitor.\n\n8) Yeast infection: Miconazole cream to vaginal area.\n\n9) Hypothyroidism: TSH initially elevated but now normalized.\nStarted Synthroid.\n\nMedications on Admission:\n1.

CXR showed only atelectasis.  He has a history\nof dCHF but appeared more intravascularly dry on exam.  He had\nno fevers or consolidations to suggest pneumonia; his\nleukocytosis was likely due to the steroids started at the OSH.\nPE was possible given his tachycardia, but the patient is at low\nrisk by Wells' Criteria.  We also considered cardiac ischemia\ngiven his history of CAD, but he had no chest pain or ischemic\nEKG changes and cardiac enzymes were negative.  He had no\narrhythmia on telemetry other than sinus tachycardia.\n\nThe patient was started on standing ipratropium and xopenex nebs\nq6h with prn xopenex, though he initially refused most of these\ntreatments.  His compliance improved when he learned that we\nwere avoiding albuterol (had been told not to take Combivent b/c\nof his CAD).  The patient was  also started on solumedrol 60mg\nIV Q8, started on [**4-14**] and continued for 7 days, with a plan to\nthen taper.  When his symptoms did not improve, he was increased\nto Solumedrol 80mg IV Q8hrs briefly.  His course was extended\nand he did not begin tapering until [**4-23**], when his solumedrol\ndose was decreased for a day before converting to oral\nprednisone.  He will complete a 10-day taper as an outpatient\nbefore stopping prednisone [**2124-5-8**].  Given his prolonged course\nof high-dose steroids, he was started on Bactrim, pantoprazole,\ncalcium and vitamin D.  He will stop the Bactrim and\npantoprazole after stopping prednisone, but continue Ca + Vit D.\n The patient is often irritable and unstable while on steroids,\nand at one point threw a commode towards a health care worker.\nHis stability improved with lowering steroid doses.\n\nLevofloxacin started in the emergency department was\ncontinued(day 1 = [**4-13**]) for an empiric course of 5 days.\nIncentive spirometry was encouraged.  The patient was very\nopposed to using home Oxygen, so after 10 days of oxygen at 5L\nby nasal cannula, he was slowly weaned starting [**4-23**].  He was\nstable off of Oxygen at the time of discharge and was able to\nambulate with physical therapy.\n\nThe patient was very opposed to any pulmonary rehab, home VNA,\nor increase in services.  These were repeatedly offered and\nrefused.\n.\n# Sinus tachycardia: Improved but did not fully resolve. Likely\nmultifactorial with components from dehydration, anxiety, and\nalbuterol nebs.  Pt tachyardic and tachypneic but afebrile; his\nclinical picture was not consistent with SIRS/sepsis as also\nexplainable by COPD. Again, low risk for PE. Substance\nwithdrawal a possibility; he denied EtOH use but concern for\noxycodone overuse at OSH given #90 oxycontin prescribed [**4-9**] and\n#10 left on admission on [**4-10**]. His tox screen was negative. He\nremained low-level tachycardic even after restarting diltiazem.\nThis is most likely his baseline.\n.\n# Acute renal failure on admission: FeNa of 0.4% suggested a\nprerenal etiology.  He got 2L IVF in ED.  U/A was not frankly\nc/w UTI. Renal ultrasound negative for obstruction.  His\ncreatinine normalized.  Initially his home lisinopril, lasix\nwere held, but were later restarted without any increase in his\ncreatinine.\n.\n# H/o glucose intolerance/steroid induced diabetes: He had\npersistent hyperglycemia, thought to be due to his steroid use,\nthough there was concern for underlying glucose intolerance.\nThe patient was unwilling to comply with any diabetic diet. His\ndose of QHS Lantus was slowly increased up to 20 units, but he\nremained very hyperglycemic, requiring large doses of Humalog\nwith each meal.  He was discharged with a decreasing dose of\nLantus given his non-compliance and the concerns for\nhypoglycemia.  After he has completed his steroids, he should\nhave a fasting glucose in case of underlying chronic diabetes.\nWe recommended that he have a visiting nurse to help with his\ninsulin but he refused.\n\n# Pain control: Pt reports chronic pain on oxycodone. There were\nquestions on admission of med overuse.  He refused to name his\npharmacy to confirm his dose.  He was found to be hiding his\noxycontin doses one day prior to discharge.\n\n# CAD: Has a h/o multiple MIs. On admission, the chest pain he\ndescribed sounded more pleuritic, atypical. EKG was w/o ischemic\nchanges; CE neg x 2.  He was started on an Aspirin given his\nrisk factors.  He again complained of chest pain [**4-24**].  EKG was\nagain unchanged and his pain improved with Maalox.\n\n# Noncompliance: He has a h/o multiple AMA discharges.

The SFA and popliteal\nwere diffusely diseased. AT with multiple regions of stenosis\nalong its length. There was also an occluded distal AT and\nreconstitution of the distal DP an dlateral tarsal. The PT and\nperoneal were occluded. The pt underwent PTA of the entire AT\nwith a 3x10 balloon. Pt had recanalization of distal AT and DP\nartery with a PTA with a 2x2 balloon. The procedure went well\nand the pt was started on ASA and plavix postop. In the early\nmorning of [**6-23**], the pt's postop course was complicated by\nrapid atrial fib. Cardiology was consulted and per their recs,\nher beta blocker was increased to 25 mg [**Hospital1 **], electrolytes were\nfollowed closely, and an echo was checked. This showed a LVEF of\n50%, 3+ MR, and 3+ TR. The pt's troponin started to trend up at\nthis time going from 0.09 to 0.1 on [**6-24**]. A podiatry consult\nwas obtained on [**6-25**] for evaluation/treatment of right second\ntoe gangreen with cellulitis.

Right Foot Ulcer:\nPatient was admitted to hospital on [**2198-6-21**] for right foot\nnon-healing ulcer. The patient was originally admitted to the\nvascular surgery service for which she underwent a right\nangioplasty of the right AT on [**2198-6-22**]. Podiatry service was then\nconsulted got gangrenous 2nd right toe. However, in setting of\nthese procedures patient had a rapid HR without drop in BP which\nwas assessed to be likely MAT for which lopressor was increased\nto 25 [**Hospital1 **] and advised to keep aggressive repletion of Mg and\nPotassium, and diurese more aggressively. While planning for\nright toe amputation,on [**2198-6-27**] the patient was found to be\ntroponin positive as well as with dropping Hct and guaiac\npositive for which GI was consulted.  However, the patient was\nunable to tolerate her golytely prep and did not receive a\ncolonoscopy as planned on [**2198-6-28**]. In the setting of a possible\nNSTEMI and GI bleed, the patient was transferred to the medicine\nservice for continued care. The patient's right foot was noted\nto have pus expressed from the foot and was opened at the\nbedside. The patient underwent a right 3rd toe amputation, which\nshe tolerated. EGD performed on [**2198-7-2**] demonstrated the patient\nto have no active bleeding. However in the setting of ongoing\ntachycardia, a colonoscopy was aborted. After this procedure the\npatient's HCt had stabilized without need for [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] or other\ndiagnostic procedures. However, post operatively the patient's\ncourse was complicated by ongoing fluid overload and pulmonary\nedema. However, attempts to diurese the patient were limited as\nher creatinine continued to rise and the patient was noted to be\noliguric. The patient continued to remain fluid overloaded. The\npatient's antibiotic coverage for her toe ulcer was originally\nZosyn, to which Vancomycin was added for Coag Positive Staph\nwhich grew from wound cultures. However, after determined to be\nMSSA, patient was switched to oxacillin on [**2198-7-2**].  Because of\nconcern for extension of infection, the patient underwent a TMA\non [**2198-7-6**] by the vascular surgery service with placement of a\nVac device post-operatively. Cardiology had previously been\nconsulted for clearance and advised that the operation was high\nrisk and should be postponed if possible. However, it was\nthought that the procedure was semi-urgent and needed to be\nperformed. In the setting of ongoing decreased urine output, and\nsevere fluid overload  with desat to 70s on floor, the patient\nwas transferred to the CCU for monitored diuresis. Conversation\nwith patient's daughter at this point confirmed that the patient\nwas DNR/DNI. Patient was successfully diuresed with no\nindication for valvuloplasty for severe AS found on\nEchocardiogram. While in the CCU patient was additionally\nstarted on Levo/Flagyl for possible pneumonia seen on Chest\nFilm. After successfully having been diuresed, the patient was\nassessed to be stable to go back to Medicine service on floor\nand was discharged to the floor on [**2198-7-13**]. The patient was\nstable overnight but reporting large pain in her foot and\nabdomen in the setting of having her vac replaced and continued\nto have runs of MAT which decreased somewhat with lopressor. The\npatient continued to report large pain and was given small\namounts of narcotic for concern of over sedating her. The\npatient's pain decreased after manipulation of her foot was\ncompleted. However, 2 hours later, the medical team was paged to\nsee the patient immediately as she was bradycardic, hypotensive,\nand hypoventilating. The patient was breathing at about a rate\nof 3 to 4 times a minute with a pulse of about 30. At that time,\nfamily members were present, including the [**Hospital 228**] Health care\nProxy (daughter) and it was decided that further care or\nprocedures should be withheld. The patient's family was allowed\nto be by her side until she was declared to be deceased. The\npatient's family declined an elective autopsy and all\nappropriate certificates and paperwork were completed.\n.\n2. NSTEMI/MAT/CHF - The patient was noted to have a  troponin\nleak in the setting of frequent MAT during her admission which\nwas determined to be likely NSTEMI vs. demand ischemia. The\npatient did not undergo any therapeutic procedures because of\nher increased risk but was medically managed. The patient had an\necho which was significant for severe AS. In the setting of her\nCHF and severe AS volume balance was particularly challenging\nthroughout her hospital stay. The patient required fair amount\nof fluid for adequate pre-load, yet was fluid overloaded with\npulmonary edema. Attempts to diurese the patient were further\ncomplicated by oliguric renal failure, ultimately which\nnecessitated transfer to the CCU for monitored diuresis as\ndescribed above. On the morning of [**2198-7-13**], the patient was\nfound to be hypotensive and bradycardic, likely secondary to her\nCAD and structural heart disease. The patient was DNR/DNI and as\nper her families wishes was not aggressively managed. The\npatient passed away on [**2198-7-13**] likely from cardiac arret\nsecondary to her CAD.\n.\n3. GI Bleed: The patient was found to have a dropping Hct during\nher admission in the setting of guaiac positive stool without\nany frank bleeding. First attempt at colonoscopy was aborted\nbecause the patient did not tolerate a GI prep. The second\nattempt was successful and the patient underwent an EGD which\ndid not show any active bleeding. A colonoscopy was not\nperformed as the patient became tachycardic during her EGD and\nwas not thought to be stable for an additional procedure. The\npatient's HCt remained relatively stable throughout her stay\nrequiring occasional blood transfusion, but not large\nrequirements (4 units over course of admission.)\n.\n4. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's creatinine\nclearance remained low throughout her admission and continued to\ndecrease with any attempts to diurese the patient. As described,\nthe patient was oliguric and eventually required transfer to the\nCCU for monitored diuresis, although this too was limited by the\npatient's poor renal function.\n\nMedications on Admission:\n1.

Since that time, breathing 30 to 60s.\n    Was felt to be delayed transition and retained fetal lung\nfluid.\n    Baby appears well with a comfortable respiratory pattern\n    at this time.\n\n2.  Cardiovascular:  Because of concern for tachypnea in a\n    term infant, a cardiac evaluation was performed.\n    Hyperoxia test was passed.  Four extremity blood\n    pressures were in the normal range and electrocardiogram\n    was normal for age. On examination, there is no murmur\n    present and hemodynamically, the infant has remained\n    stable throughout the hospital course, APs ranging 110 to\n    130 and normal blood pressures.  Capillary blood gas was\n    7.41, 37.\n\n3.  FEN (Fluids and electrolytes):  Initially, baby was\n    maintained n.p.o. on total fluids of 60 ml/kg of\n    intravenous fluids. Blood glucose was noted to be in\n    normal range as were serum electrolytes.  Urine output\n    was also adequate and meconium stools were passed by day\n    of life 1.  She had a nasogastric tube to empty her\n    stomach while on CPAP with a large gastric bubble noted\n    on film which resolved.  Enteral feeds were started when\n    respiratory symptoms resolved and baby has been p.o. ad\n    lib feeding Enfamil 20, taking good volumes and gaining\nweight. Intravenous\n    fluids have been discontinued.  Discharge weight is 2215\ngrams.\n\n4.  Gastrointestinal:  Serum bilirubin  on [**11-11**], day\n    of life 3, was 15.1/0.3.  Phototherapy was initiated and on\n[**11-12**] at 6am the level was 12.5/0.3.  Phototherapy was\ndiscontinued.   Jaundice likely exaggerated physiologic\nhyperbilirubinemia due to delay in enteral feeds.\n\n5.  Hematologic/Infectious disease:  A CBC and blood culture\n    were obtained on admission, revealing a white count of\n    18.3 with 72 polys, 0 bands and 20 lymphocytes.\n    Hematocrit was 46.9% and platelets were adequate at 258.\n    Baby was started on ampicillin and gentamicin which\n    continued for 48 hours and then discontinued in light\n    of negative cultures and improving clinical course.\n\n6.  Neurology: Baby has a normal neurologic examination.\n\n7.

Blood\ntype B+, antibody negative, hepatitis B surface antigen\nnegative, RPR nonreactive and rubella immune, GBS unknown.\nPrenatal course was significant for 1) di-di twin gestation,\nIVF assisted. 2) Presentation at 20-2/7 weeks gestation to\n[**Hospital3 **] with cramping and headache. Her blood\npressure was noted to be 145/91, and she was transferred to\n[**Hospital1 18**] for observation and monitoring for HELLP syndrome. Due\nto probable labor, she received magnesium sulfate tocolysis.\nThere was no evidence for HELLP. 3) Ms. [**Known lastname 71848**] received\n2 doses of betamethasone, beta-complete on [**2122-2-21**]\nat 3:00 p.m. 4) Recent fetal survey showed normal fetal\nanatomy and EFW 40 percentile for twin A and 38 percentile\nfor twin B.\n\nPAST OBSTETRIC HISTORY:  In [**2115**], a 32 week gestation\ndelivered at [**Hospital1 3278**]-[**Hospital1 336**] NICU due to maternal HELLP syndrome.\nSon is now 6 years old and doing well except for reactive\nairway disease.\n\n[**Hospital **] MEDICAL HISTORY:  Asthma, history of\ncholecystectomy, receiving baby aspirin.\n\nOn the day of delivery, since this twin was noted to have\ndecels and the mother with signs of labor, the obstetrical\nteam elected to deliver these twins due to breech position,\nand this twin delivery was by C-section. The infant was born\non [**2122-2-23**] at 03:46 p.m. He emerged with good color\nand heart rate but poor respiratory effort. He received PPV,\nin addition to stimulation and drying. He had a good response\nbut due to lack of sustained respiratory effort, he was\nintubated in the delivery room. Apgars were 5 and 7. Of note,\nthe obstetrician noted signs of abruption at delivery. GBS\nwas unknown but there was no maternal fever. Rupture of\nmembranes occurred at the time of delivery. No intrapartum\nantibiotics were given.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION AT DISCHARGE:  Weight 2780 grams. Height\nand head circumference to be entered later. GENERAL: The baby\nis [**Name2 (NI) **] and comfortable in room air. Anterior fontanel open\nand flat. No cleft palate. Red reflex present bilaterally. No\nneck masses. The heart is regular rate and rhythm. There is a\nsoft 2/6 systolic ejection murmur, musical in quality, in the\nleft sternal border. The lungs are clear to auscultation\nbilaterally. No retractions.

Anus patent. GU: Testes\ndescended bilaterally. Neuro: Strong suck and grasp. Good\ntone, symmetric bilaterally.\n\nSUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:  RESPIRATORY: The baby\nwas intubated in the delivery room, and he was intubated for\nless than 24 hours, received surfactant x1. He remained on\nCPAP for the next 7 days and then was transitioned to room\nair. He was started on caffeine on day of life 2 and has had\nmild apnea of prematurity. Caffeine was discontinued on [**2122-4-3**]. He has not had apnea since then, but has had mild\nbradycardias with feeds, the last one on [**2122-4-13**]. At\ndischarge, he is breathing room air, rates of 40s to 60s,\ncomfortable.\n\nCARDIOVASCULAR: An echo was done due to a murmur that was\nnoted on [**2-27**]. The echo showed no PDA, just a PFO with\ngood biventricular function. The baby still has a murmur,\nmusical in quality, left sternal border, which sounds benign,\neither a flow murmur or a PPS murmur which will require clinical\nfollow-up. He has strong femoral\npulses, blood pressures are stable, and he is well-perfused. The\nlast episode of apnea and bradycardia occured 5 days prior to\ndischarge.\n\nFLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES, NUTRITION; He was initially n.p.o. and\nmaintained on IV fluids. Feeds were started on day of life 3.\nHe did have feeding intolerance initially, was made n.p.o.\nagain due to aspirates on day of life 5. Feeds were restarted\non day of life 8. The UVC was discontinued on [**3-2**],\nday of life 8. Feeds were gradually advanced. He also\nremained on parenteral nutrition. He worked-up to the 30\ncal/oz breast milk with Beneprotein. Prior to discharge,\ncalories were weaned. He continued to gain good weight. At\ndischarge, he is feeding breast milk 24 cal/oz with Similac\npowder.\n\nGI: He was on phototherapy for a few days with a peak total\nbilirubin of 3.7 on day of life 4. Phototherapy was\ndiscontinued, and bilirubins at follow-up have been stable,\nthe last one 2.4/0.5 on day of life 14.\n\nHEMATOLOGY: The baby's blood type is B+, Coombs negative. His\nhematocrit on admission was 50.4. He was never transfused.\nFerrous sulfate was started on day of life 23 along with\nvitamin E. His latest hematocrit was 31 with a reticulocyte\nof 6.8 on [**2122-4-16**]. Calcium was 10.1, phosphorus 6.7,\nalkaline phosphatase  382. Of note, the baby does have a\nsmall hemangioma above his left ear about 4 x 3 mm in size.\n\nINFECTIOUS DISEASE: The baby was started on ampicillin and\ngentamicin at birth. He remained on the antibiotics for 48\nhours, at which time they were discontinued with negative\nblood cultures. There have been no concerns for infection\nthroughout the remainder of the hospitalization.\n\nNEUROLOGY: Head ultrasounds on [**2-25**], [**3-3**] and\n[**2122-3-26**] were all normal.\n\nSENSORY: Hearing screening was performed with automated\nauditory brain stem responses. The baby passed in both ears\nprior to discharge.\n\nOPHTHALMOLOGY: The latest eye exam done on [**2122-4-13**]\nshowed bilateral immature retinas in zone 11. Follow-up was\nrecommended in 2 weeks.\n\nCONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Stable.\n\nDISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  To home.\n\nNAME OF PRIMARY PEDIATRICIAN:  Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 47894**], phone\nnumber ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 71849**].\n\nCARE/RECOMMENDATIONS:\n1.

Medications: Ferrous sulfate 4 mg/kg/D, multivitamins 1\n    mL p.o. q.24h., iron and vitamin D supplementation. Iron\n    supplementation is recommended for preterm and low\n    birthweight infants until 12 months corrected age. All\n    infants fed predominantly breast milk should receive\n    vitamin D supplementation at 200 IU being provided as a\n    multivitamin preparation daily until 12 months corrected\n    age.\n3.  Car seat position screening was done and the baby passed\n    prior to discharge.\n4.  State newborn screen was normal on [**2122-3-20**].\n5.  Immunizations given: Include hepatitis B vaccine on [**3-25**], [**2122**].\n6.  Immunizations recommended: Synagis RSV prophylaxis should\n    be considered from [**Month (only) **] through [**Month (only) 958**] for infants who\n    meet any of the following 4 criteria: 1) Born at less\n    than 32 weeks, 2) Born between 32 and 35 weeks with 2 of\n    the following: Daycare during RSV season, a smoker in the\n    household, neuromuscular disease, airway abnormalities or\n    school-age siblings, 3) Chronic lung disease, or 4)\n    Hemodynamically significant CHD. Influenza immunization\n    is recommended annually in the fall for all infants once\n    they reach 6 months of age. Before this age and for the\n    first 24 months of the child's life, immunization against\n    influenza is recommended for household contacts and out-\n    of-home caregivers. This infant has not received the\n    Rotavirus vaccine. The American Academy of Pediatrics\n    recommends initial vaccination of preterm infants at or\n    following discharge from the hospital if they are\n    clinically stable and at least 6 weeks but fewer than 12\n    weeks of age.\n7.

This pregnancy was complicated by\nfindings on ultrasound at 17 weeks of bilateral\nhydronephrosis with echogenic renal parenchyma, dilated\nureters, 2-vessel umbilical cord and a distended bladder with\nureterocele.  Cystic changes within the kidneys were also\nseen on some scans. The patient was followed closely with\nserial ultrasounds and was also seen by antenatal fetal\ncontinuing care center at [**Hospital3 1810**] including Dr.\n[**Last Name (STitle) 61096**], of urology and the genetic service.\n\nDifferential diagnosis included a primary kidney dysplastic\ndisorder, reflux, obstruction from ureterocele and posterior\nureteral valves. Amniocentesis was performed with normal\nkaryotype. Follow up ultrasound initially showed improvement\nof the hydronephrosis with normal amniotic fluid volume\nalthough the kidneys remained echogenic and the bladder\ndilated with persistent ureterocele. Fetal echo was normal.\nUltrasound on [**12-3**] was concerning for decreasing AFI.\nMore notable cystic changes of right kidney and inability to\nvisualize the left kidney. Similar findings were seen on\nultrasound on [**12-7**] with an AFI of 1 to 2 and mother was\ntaken for cesarean section delivery.\n\nThe infant delivered and was found to be difficult to remove\nfrom the abdomen and required being extracted feet first.\nModerate bleeding was noted due to position of the placenta.\nThe infant emerged with moderate tone and weak cry, initially\nvery pale but responded quickly to stimulation and positive\npressure ventilation. Apgars were found as 5, and 9.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Weight 2.265 kg, 50th to 75th\npercentile; head circumference 34 cm, greater than 90th\npercentile. Active premature infant in moderate respiratory\ndistress at rest. Pale, pink. Cap refill 1.5 to 2 seconds. No\nrash. Excoriations over inguinal creases bilaterally.\nFontanel soft and flat.

NEURO: Appropriate activity and tone and intact\ngrasp.\n\nSUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:  RESPIRATORY:  Infant\nwas admitted to the newborn intensive care unit and placed on\nCPAP with progressive respiratory distress. A decision was\nmade to intubate the infant. He received a total of 2 doses\nof surfactant for treatment of respiratory distress syndrome\nand he currently is on SIMV of 20, PIP of 20, PEEP of 5,\nrequiring anywhere from 21 to 30% oxygen. Capillary blood\ngases had pH of 7.31, PCO2 43, PO2 26, TCO2 23 and base\ndeficit of minus 5.\n\nCARDIOVASCULAR: Infant was evaluated by cardiology secondary\nto a murmur. Cardiology was unable to assess the murmur as it\nwas no longer audible. Murmur appreciated again [**12-8**] pm.  Will\nneed to obtain EKG and reconsult with Cardiology at [**Hospital3 18242**].\n\nFLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION: Infant's birth weight was\n2265 grams.

Magnesium level\nwas 1.8.\n\nGASTROINTESTINAL: The infant was noted on [**12-8**], around\n9 p.m. to have a full distended abdomen. KUB was obtained\ndemonstrating dilated bowel loops. The infant has been\npassing stool. [**Last Name (un) 37079**] was placed to air ventilation,\notherwise no GI issues.\n\nGENITOURINARY:  Prenatal diagnosis including cystic kidneys,\ndistended bladder, dilated ureters, echogenic renal\nparenchyma, bilateral ureterocele. Renal ultrasound done on\n[**12-7**]. Findings include bilateral renal cystic\ndysplasia, both kidneys containing numerous small cysts.\nRight renal length is 3.15 cm with approximately 8 renal\ncysts in number spread throughout the peripheral cortex of\nthe right kidney. There is also dilated right ureter which\nappears to subtend the upper pole of the right kidney. Left\nkidney measures 3.3 cm and has small cysts. There is a large\nhydroureter, most likely comes from the left upper pole of\nthe left kidney. Left hydroureter ends in a large left\nintravesical ureterocele, normal sized bladder. The\nureterocele does not appear to be extracting the outflow of\nurine from the bladder. Urology was consulted. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 61096**] has\nseen the patient and requested transfer to [**Hospital3 18242**] for VCUG and further following.\n\nConsulted Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and recommended VCUG. His [**Hospital3 18242**] pager number is [**Pager number **]. Urine output has been\nincreasing. His urine output for the last day was 1.2 cc per\nkg per hour up from 0.4 cc per kg per hour.\n\nHEMATOLOGY: Hematocrit on admission was 33.2. The infant has\nnot received any blood products during this hospital course.\nThe family is interested in direct donor.\n\nINFECTIOUS DISEASE: CBC and blood culture were obtained on\nadmission. CBC was benign. Blood cultures remained negative\nat 48 hours. The infant was started on ampicillin and\ngentamycin in light of respiratory escalation. Gentamycin at\npre level was 2.1. Gentamycin was continued at that time. The\ninfant received 2 days of ampicillin high dose and changed to\nUTI prophylaxis today.\n\nNEUROLOGIC: Infant has been appropriate for gestational age.\n\nSENSORY:  Hearing screen has not been performed but should be\ndone prior to discharge.\n\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Guarded.\n\nDISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  To [**Hospital3 1810**].\n\nNAME OF PRIMARY PEDIATRICIAN:  Not yet identified.\n\nCARE RECOMMENDATIONS:\n1.

The views of the right\npelvis are\nunremarkable.\nIMPRESSION: No fracture or definite evidence of multiple myeloma\nin the right femur.\n.\nUNILAT LOWER EXT VEINS RIGHT\nFINDINGS: The right common femoral, superficial femoral, and\npopliteal veins demonstrate normal compressibility, flow, and\naugmentation. The right peroneal and posterior tibial veins\ndemonstrate color flow. Subcutaneous edema is noted.\nIMPRESSION: No evidence for DVT. Subcutaneous edema.\n.\nPORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Mild cardiomegaly is increased\ncompared to the\nprior exam. Bilateral interstitial edema is improved. New focal\nnodularity\nparticularly within the left lung are concerning for\ndisseminated infection. Prominence and some minimal\nopacification at the right lung base may represent atelectasis\nor worsening pulmonary edema, although infection cannot be\nentirely excluded in the correct clinical setting.\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Interstitial edema is improved compared to the prior exam.\n2. Mild cardiomegaly is increased compared to the prior exam.\n3. Focal nodularity predominantly in left lung, new since the\nprior exam, is concerning for disseminated infection. A\ndedicated CT of the chest is\nrecommended for further evaluation.\n.\nCT Chest W/O Contrast:\nFINDINGS:\nThe thyroid gland appears unremarkable.\nThe mediastinal, axillary and hilar lymph nodes do not meet size\ncriteria for pathology. The main pulmonary artery measures 3.1\ncm, concerning for\npulmonary hypertension. Coronary artery calcifications are\nnoted.\nAtherosclerotic calcifications are noted within the arch of the\naorta.\nCentrilobular nodular branching opacities are noted in bilateral\nlungs, left greater than right, consistent with bronchiolitis.\nThese are lower lobe predominant. Larger nodules and\nconsolidations are noted particularly within the right medial\nlower lobe. Overall findings may represent airway secretions\nwith widespread aspiration complicated by bronchopneumonia or\ndiffuse airway infection due to viral or mycoplasma infection.\nModerate cardiomegaly is noted. Bilateral pleural effusions are\nidentified, right greater than left, with adjacent compressive\natelectasis. Ground-glass opacity and minimal septal thickening\nis also noted in both lungs which may represent pulmonary edema.\n\nLeft superior segment bronchus appears obstructed which may be\nsecondary to secretions. Secretions are also noted layering\ndependantly along the airways within the trachea and right\nbronchus (series 4, image 79).\nThis study is not optimized for subdiaphragmatic evaluation.\nWithin this\nlimitation, the upper abdominal structures appear unremarkable.\nVisualized osseous structures show no focal lytic or sclerotic\nlesions\nsuspicious for malignancy.\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Diffuse bronchiolitis and early bronchopneumonia which may be\nsecondary to viral or mycoplasma infection. Alternatively,\nconsidering intraluminal airway secretions and dependent\npredominance, aspiration pneumonia is an additional\nconsideration.\n2. Cardiomegaly and mild hydrostatic pulmonary edema.\n3. Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, with\nadjacent atelectasis.\n4. Main pulmonary artery measures 3.1 cm, raising the\npossibility for pulmonary hypertension.\n.\n[**2174-2-18**] Chest X-ray:\nSince many of the findings described in today's study can\noverlap with\nfindings that of pulmonary amyloidosis, a three-month followup\nCT is\nrecommended to determine resolution. In comparison with study of\n[**2-8**], there is continued enlargement of the heart with evidence\nof vascular congestion. However, the diffuse areas of pulmonary\nopacification bilaterally have substantially reduced. There is,\nhowever, some opacification in the retrocardiac area with\npossible air bronchograms, raising the possibility of a lower\nlung pneumonia. There is a pleural effusion most likely at the\nleft base, though there may be a small effusion on the right as\nwell.\n.\nMicrobiology:\n[**2174-2-8**] 3:16 am URINE      Source: Catheter.\n                            **FINAL REPORT [**2174-2-9**]**\n   URINE CULTURE (Final [**2174-2-9**]):    NO GROWTH.\n.\n[**2174-2-8**] 6:45 am BLOOD CULTURE      Source: Venipuncture.\n   Blood Culture, Routine (Pending) time 2\n.\n[**2174-2-8**] 3:16 am URINE      HEM# 0112D [**2-8**].\n                            **FINAL REPORT [**2174-2-9**]**\n   Legionella Urinary Antigen  (Final [**2174-2-9**]):\n      NEGATIVE FOR LEGIONELLA SEROGROUP 1 ANTIGEN.\n           (Reference Range-Negative).\n      Performed by Immunochromogenic assay.\n      A negative result does not rule out infection due to other\nL.\n      pneumophila serogroups or other Legionella species.\nFurthermore, in\n      infected patients the excretion of antigen in urine may\nvary.\n.\n[**2174-2-8**] 4:25 pm SPUTUM      Source: Expectorated.\n   GRAM STAIN (Final [**2174-2-8**]):\n      \u003e25 PMNs and \u003c10 epithelial cells/100X field.\n      2+   (1-5 per 1000X FIELD):   GRAM NEGATIVE ROD(S).\n      1+    (\u003c1 per 1000X FIELD):   GRAM NEGATIVE DIPLOCOCCI.\n   RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Preliminary):\n      SPARSE GROWTH Commensal Respiratory Flora.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n# Cardiomyopathy secondary to amyloidosis:  The patient was\ninitially admitted for tachycardia and fevers.

There\nwas no evidence of apraxia or neglect.  He was aware of the\npassive voice, and could do two step commands.  He could do\ncalculations without problems.  I am not clear if this was a\nlanguage difficulty and problems of doing the exam through an\ninterpreter, but I got the sense that the commands \"such as\nrepeat\" took a few times at explanation, however he was always\nable to complete the task.\n\nOn subsequent examination:\nHe had frequent word finding pauses in English with occasionally\na telegraphic pattern in which he left out articles, repetition\nwas impaired for example \"President DC\" for The President Lives\nin WashingtonDC, \"Girl (unclear word)\" for the Boy Chased the\nGirl Around the Big [**Doctor Last Name **], occasional phonemic errors for example\nwhen he was describing his work errors for \"protein\" stating\n\"proterein\". He was mildly perseverative. Comprehension was fair\nbut clearly impaired, for example asking him to tell me if a\npotato was a vegetable or meat, he chose meat. Following\ncommands was variable. He clearly got the semantic gist of many\nutterances. When asked to show me body parts, he made errors\nsuch as pointing to his eyes when asked to point to his nose.

She refused to stay in the\nhospital any longer and it was felt she would be safer at home\n\n\nDischarge Instructions:\nDISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS FOLLOWING s/p repair b/l femoral a.\npseudoaneurysm and b/l femoral endarterectomy SURGERY\n\nThis information is designed as a guideline to assist you in a\nspeedy recovery from your surgery. Please follow these\nguidelines unless your physician has specifically instructed you\notherwise. Please call our office nurse if you have any\nquestions. Dial 911 if you have any medical emergency.\n\nACTIVITY:\n\nThere are no specific restrictions on activity. You should be as\nactive as is comfortable. Some fatigue is expected for the first\nseveral weeks. Leg swelling is typical following this type of\nsurgery and can be controlled by elevating your leg above the\nlevel of your heart when you are not walking.\n\nPLEASE CALL US IMMEDIATELY FOR ANY OF THE FOLLOWING PROBLEMS:\n\nRedness in or drainage from your leg wound(s).\n\nNew pain, numbness or discoloration of your foot or toes.\n\nWatch for signs and symptoms of infection. These are: a fever\ngreater than 101 degrees, chills, increased redness, or pus\ndraining from the incision site. If you experience any of these\nor bleeding at the incision site, CALL THE DOCTOR.\n\nExercise:\n\nLimit strenuous activity for 4 weeks.\n\nNo heavy lifting greater than 20 pounds for the next 7 days.\n\nDo not drive untill cleared by surgeon\n\nBATHING/SHOWERING:\n\nYou shower immediately upon coming home. No bathing. A clear\ndressing may cover your leg incision and this should be left in\nplace for three (3) days. Remove it after this time and wash\nyour incision(s) gently with soap and water. Dissolving sutures,\nwhich do not have to be removed, were probably used.\n\nIf you have staples these will be removed on your follow-up\nappointment.\n\nWOUND CARE:\n\nSutures / Staples may be removed before discharge. If they are\nnot, an appointment will be made for you to return for\nremoval.).\n\nWhen the sutures / staples are removed the doctor may or may not\nplace pieces of tape called steri-strips over the incision.\nThese will stay on about a week and you may shower with them on.\nIf these do not fall off after 10 days, you may peel them off\nwith warm water and soap in the shower.\n\nAvoid taking a tub bath, swimming, or soaking in a hot tub for\ntwo weeks after surgery.\n\nMEDICATIONS:\n\nUnless told otherwise you should resume taking all of the\nmedications you were taking before surgery. You will be given a\nnew prescription for pain medication, which can be taken every\nthree (3) to four (4) hours only if necessary.\n\nRemember that narcotic pain meds can be constipating and you\nshould increase the fluid and bulk foods in your diet. (Check\nwith your physician if you have fluid restrictions.) If you feel\nthat you are constipated, do not strain at the toilet. You may\nuse over the counter Metamucil or Milk of Magnesia. Appetite\nsuppression may occur; this will improve with time. Eat small\nbalanced meals throughout the day.\n\nCAUTIONS:\n\nNO SMOKING! We know you've heard this before, but it really is\nan important step to your recovery. Smoking causes narrowing of\nyour blood vessels which in turn decreases circulation. If you\nsmoke you will need to stop as soon as possible. Ask your nurse\nor doctor for information on smoking cessation.\n\nAvoid bending for 4-6 weeks.\n\nNo strenuous activity for 4-6 weeks after surgery.\n\nDIET :\n\nThere are no special restrictions on your diet postoperatively.\nPoor appetite is expected for several weeks and small, frequent\nmeals may be preferred.\n\nFor people with vascular problems we would recommend a\ncholesterol lowering diet: Follow a diet low in total fat and\nlow in saturated fat and in cholesterol to improve lipid profile\nin your blood. Additionally, some people see a reduction in\nserum cholesterol by reducing dietary cholesterol. Since a\nreduction in dietary cholesterol is not harmful, we suggest that\nmost people reduce dietary fat, saturated fat and cholesterol to\ndecrease total cholesterol and LDL (Low Density Lipoprotein-the\nbad cholesterol). Exercise will increase your HDL (High Density\nLipoprotein-the good cholesterol) and with your doctor's\npermission, is typically recommended. You may be self-referred\nor get a referral from your doctor.\n\nIf you are overweight, you need to think about starting a weight\nmanagement program. Your health and its improvement depend on\nit. We know that making changes in your lifestyle will not be\neasy, and it will require a whole new set of habits and a new\nattitude. If interested you can may be self-referred or can get\na referral from your doctor.\n\nIf you have diabetes and would like additional guidance, you may\nrequest a referral from your doctor.\n\nFOLLOW-UP APPOINTMENT:\n\nBe sure to keep your medical appointments. The key to your\nimproving health will be to keep a tight reign on any of the\nchronic medical conditions that you have. Things like high blood\npressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol are major villains to\nthe blood vessels. Don't let them go untreated!\n\nPlease call the office on the first working day after your\ndischarge from the hospital to schedule a follow-up visit. This\nshould be scheduled on the calendar for seven to fourteen days\nafter discharge. Normal office hours are 8:30-5:00 Monday\nthrough Friday.\n\nPLEASE FEEL FREE TO CALL THE OFFICE WITH ANY OTHER CONCERNS OR\nQUESTIONS THAT MIGHT ARISE.\n\n\nFollowup Instructions:\nCall Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 8888**] office in two weeks and schedule an appoinment\nfor 2 weeks.

Surgeon was Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. A double-J ureteral stent\nwas not placed due to small ureteral size. A 19 [**Doctor Last Name 406**] drain was\nplaced in the retroperitoneum. Induction immunosuppression (ATG,\nsolumedrol and cellcept)were administered. Please refer to\noperative notes for complete details. After closing, he was\nhypotensive requiring pressor support. ECG had new ST segment\ndepressions laterally and ST elevation in aVR. A NTG drip was\ngiven. Cardiology was consulted. TTE was performed with moderate\nLVH, MAC, small LVcavity, mild inferior and inferolateral HK but\noverall preserved EF, and nl RV/septal motion. Cardiac enzymes\nwere checked showing a troponin leak. He was transferred to the\nSICU where a heparin drip was run. Hypotensive response was felt\nto be possibly due to ATG. Cardiology recomended lopressor and\nstatin with repeat TTE during this admission.\n\nHct dropped from 35 to 31. He was given PRBC. Heparin drip was\nstopped and hct stabilized. Home doses of [**Doctor Last Name **] and plavix were\nresumed.\n\nA total of 3 doses of ATG were given after premedication with\ntylenol/benadryl and higher doses of solumedrol as well as\nslower administration of ATG. Over the next few days, urine\noutput increased to 3-4 liters and creatinine trended down to\n5.5. Foley was removed without incident. IV fluids were stopped.\nDiet was advanced and tolerated. Pain was controlled with oral\nmeds.\n\nExtensive medication teaching was done. Steroids were tapered.\nCellect was well tolerated. Prograf was up-titrated to 12mg [**Hospital1 **]\nfor slowly rising prograf levels (7.7).\n\nA repeat TTE was done per Cardiology demonstrating severe\nsymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Overall LVSF was normal\n(LVEF\u003e55%)with possible focal inferior hypokinesis (although not\nseen consistently in all views). Doppler parameters were most\nconsistent with Grade II (moderate) left ventricular diastolic\ndysfunction\" and moderate pulmonary artery systolic\nhypertension.  Lopressor doses were increased for SBPs up to\n190. Home doses of hydralazine were resumed, isosorbide was\nincreased and Norvasc was added with some improvement of BP.\n\nOf note, he required an insulin drip for a day to control\nhyperglycemia from the steroids. This was switched to SQ insulin\n(NPH and Humalog)with improved glucose control.\n\nHe was ambulatory. PT cleared him for home with a cane. VNA\nservices were arranged as he was discharged with his JP drain\nwhich averaged 90-145cc of serosanuinous fluid.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nLyrica 25', Humalog SSI (usually 12 units qmeal), Levamir 28\nUnits [**Last Name (LF) 5910**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] 325', Nefidical 90\", Isosorbide 30', Loperamide\n2', Lipitor 80', Hydralazine 75''', Toporol 350', Plavix 75',\nTrazadone 50', Lisinopril 20', Zetia 10'\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.

On [**2147-8-17**], the\npatient underwent exploratory laparotomy, double bypass\nconsisting of Roux-en-Y, choledochojejunostomy and\ngastroenterostomy, celiac lymph node biopsy for staging,\nplacement of CyberKnife gold fiducial seeds, extended\nadhesiolysis, which went well without complication (reader\nreferred to the Operative Note for details). In the PACU, the\npatient experienced tachycardia, low urine output, and\nhypotesion, for which he received a total of 1 liter in fluid\nboluses and albumin with good response. Cardiac enzymes were\nnegative. EKG without ectopy or arrythmia. Later, the patient\nwas transferred to the floor NPO with an NG tube, on IV fluids,\nwith a foley catheter and a JP drain in place. He received a\nsingle dose of intra-thecal morphine prior to surgery with good\npain control on POD#0. The patient was hemodynamically stable.\n.\nPost-operative pain was initially well controlled with the\nintra-thecal morphine on POD#0 and then a Dilaudid PCA\nthereafter, which was converted to oral pain medication when\ntolerating clear liquids. The NG tube and foley catheter were\ndiscontinued on POD#4. Unfortunately, the patient was unable to\nvoid and the foley catheter was replaced. The patient has a\nhistory of BPH. Home dose of Flomax was restarted. On POD#6, the\nfoley was again discontinued, again the patient was unable to\nvoid, and the foley was replaced. Urology was consulted. As per\ntheir recommendations, the foley was maintained in place until\nPOD 11, when the patient was again having urinary tract pain. A\nU/A was sent and negative for infection and at the patient's\nrequest the catheter again d/c'ed for a voiding trial. He was\nagain unable to pass urine and the catheter re-inserted, he was\nsent home on his BPH meds with urology follow up as an\noutpatient. The patient was started on sips of clears on POD#5,\nwhich was progressively advanced as tolerated to a regular diet\nby POD#6. The JP was discontinued on POD#7.\n.\nDuring this hospitalization, the patient ambulated early and\nfrequently, was adherent with respiratory toilet and incentive\nspirrometry, and actively participated in the plan of care. The\npatient received subcutaneous heparin and venodyne boots were\nused during this stay. The patient's blood sugar was monitored\nregularly throughout the stay; sliding scale insulin was\nadministered when indicated. When tolerating clears, he was\nrestarted on his home hypoglycemic medications, with the\nexception of Januvia, which is not formulary.\n.\nOvernight on POD#3, the patient became agitated and exhibited\nsundowning behavior. His experienced similar symptoms for the\nnext few nights. The Psychiatric Clinical Nurse Specialist and\nSocail Worker were consulted. He received Haldol PRN and\nre-orientation. As his recovery progressed, this behavior\nimproved.\n.\nOn POD 7 the patient was noted to have 2 small areas of wound\nbreakdown around the incision line, in these areas the staples\nwere removed and small pieces of saline soaked gauze was used to\npack them sterily. A wound culture grew MSSA and he was started\non levoquin. The areas were packed for the remainder of his stay\nand he was discharged on 5 days of levoquin with VNA for wet-to\ndry packing changes.\n.\nAt the time of discharge on POD 12, the patient was doing well,\nafebrile with stable vital signs.  The patient was tolerating a\nregular diet, although with poor appetite, ambulating, and pain\nwas well controlled. The foley catheter was in place and patent.\nHe was discharged to an extended care facility. The patient\nreceived discharge teaching and follow-up instructions with\nunderstanding verbalized and agreement with the discharge plan.\n\nMedications on Admission:\n1.

Left ventricular wall thicknesses are\nnormal. The left ventricular cavity is small. Overall left\nventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%). The right\nventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular\ncavity is dilated with borderline normal free wall function.\nThere is abnormal systolic septal motion/position consistent\nwith right ventricular pressure overload. The aortic valve\nleaflets are moderately thickened. There is a minimally\nincreased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve\nstenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve\nleaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve\nprolapse. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired\nrelaxation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.\nModerate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There\nis severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no\npericardial effusion.\n.\n[**2126-4-13**] CXR\nThe lung volumes are near normal, the hemidiaphragms are\nrelatively low, but not flattened. Moderate scoliosis leads to\nasymmetry of the rib cage. In both lungs, right more than left,\na reticular pattern of opacities is seen in both perihilar\nregions and in the right upper region.  Without comparison, the\nnature of these lesions is difficult to determine, they could be\nthe result of fibrotic or a chronic inflammatory process, but\ncould also result from chronic overhydration.\nModerately enlarged cardiac silhouette, slightly enlarged right\nand left\nhilus, potentially suggesting pulmonary hypertension. No\nevidence of pleural effusions, no acute overhydration. Bilateral\napical thickening.\n.\n[**2126-4-13**] Lower extremity doppler U/S\nPreliminary Report !!

TnI was 1.9 with normal CK. She was given\naspirin, plavix, lovenox, and lopressor. A similar EKG was\nobtained upon transfer to [**Hospital1 18**]. Cardiac cath [**4-12**] revealed a\nright-dominant system with a calcified 50% proximal stenosis in\nthe RCA but no angiographically apparent disease in the LMCA,\nLAD, and LCX. TTE [**2126-4-12**] revealed normal left atrial size with\nan estimated right atrial pressure 10-20mmHg, normal left\nventricular wall thickness and a small left ventricular cavity,\nnormal left ventricular systolic function (LVEF 70%),\nhypertrophied right ventricular free wall, dilated right\nventricular cavity with borderline normal free wall function,\nabnormal systolic septal motion/position consistent with right\nventricular pressure overload, moderately thickened aortic valve\nleaflets with a minimally increased gradient consistent with\nminimal aortic valve stenosis, mildly thickened mitral valve\nleaflets, left ventricular inflow pattern suggesting impaired\nrelaxation, mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets with\nmoderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation, and severe\npulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Cardiac enzymes were\ntrended with no elevation in her CK's threfore this was felt not\nto be cardiac ischemia.\n.\n2) Pulmonary Embolus - On hospital day 2, the patient had\nlow-grade fever, tachycardia, worsening hypoxemia with resting\noxygen saturation in the mid 90's on 6 L NC, new T-wave\ninversions in V3 and deeper T-wave inversions in V4. CTA of the\nchest revealed right middle lobe segmental pulmonary emboli,\nright middle lobe pulmonary infarct vs. atelectasis, moderate\nbilateral pleural effusions, and volume overload. Heparin and\nlasix infusions were started. Lower extremity doppler ultrasound\nwas negative for DVT.\n.\n3) Left femoral neck fracture - Seen in consultation by\northopaedic surgery who recommended proceeding with ORIF.\nHowever, based on the preference of the patient and her family,\nshe was transferred to [**Hospital3 3583**] for further management.\n\n\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nCelexa 10mg PO daily\nOmeprazole 20mg PO daily\nSenna 2 tabs daily at 4pm\nLisinopril 5 mg PO daily\nLidoderm 5% patch, one patch to lower back 12 hrs each day\nCalcium with Vit D 600mg PO BID\nTylenol 650mg Q4hrs PRN for pain\nCompazine 10mg PO BID PRN nausea/vomiting\nIbuprofen prn\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.

He had completed treatment for cDiff two\n[**Known lastname **] prior to this, and the [**Known lastname **] of presentation to the OSH, he\npresented with abdominal distension and vomiting of brownish\nliquid. He was given Zofran in the outside hospital, and a\nurinalysis was questionable for infection. The patient was given\n500 mg IV levo for this. A KUB at the outside hospital showed\nadynamic ileus. The outside hospital was concerned about toxic\nmegacolon given these findings and history of cDiff. A non-con\nCT scan was performed to evaluate this possibility. The patient\nwas sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.\n\nUpon presentation to the ED, the patient was found to be\nhypotensive and hypoxic. The patient had blood pressures with\nsystolics down into the 80s (previously 146/93 at outside\nhospital). The patient was resuscitated with 2 liters of fluid\nand did not require pressors.\n\nThe patient was afebrile. Due to concerns for HAP and aspiration\nPNA, a CXR was performed, and was read as atelectasis. The ED\nphysicians were concerned about possible infiltrate of left\nlower lobe. Sputum, blood, and urine cultures were obtained. The\npatient did not complain of significant abdominal pain, but the\nabdomen was noted to be distended on exam. Surgery service at\n[**Hospital1 18**] evaluated non-con CT of abdomen from OSH, and described\nthat there was no evidence of obstruction or other condition\nrequiring surgical intervention. A KUB was ordered from the ED\ndue to a concern for toxic megacolon, but there was no evidence\nof such. The patient was started on vancomycin, Flagyl, and\ncefepime for broad coverage.\n\nAlso of note, the patient had elevated cardiac enzymes in the\nED, wich a troponin of 0.23. Cardiology evaluted the EKG but did\nnot find any revealing changes. There were some elvations in\nV2-V4 suggestive of demand ischemia. Cardiology suggested\nevaluating the patient further with CK/CK-MB. The patient's\nblood pressure remained stable, however, and the patient\ncomplained of no chest pain.\n\n\nPast Medical History:\n- Cerebral Palsy: congenital left hemiparesis, requiring\nnumerous ankle surgeries and muscle grafts, At baseline he is\nmostly wheelchair bound and has limited verbal cability and has\n24 hour supervision\n- Traumatic Brain Injury: result of motor vehicle accident in\n[**2094**], subdural hemorrhage, left craniotomy, left hemispheric\ninfact, and resulting simple partial seizure disorder,\n- ESRD: on HD, etiology unclear, S/P renal biopsy\n- JG tube\n- cDiff ?????? due to concern for toxic megacolon in setting of\npreviously treated cDiff, ID doc at outside hospital recommended\nPO vanc or i.v.

Abdominal distention and findings of adynamic ileus\non KUB at OSH were concerning for toxic megacolon.  ID at OSH\nrecommended starting p.r. vanc + i.v. flagyl or just p.o. vanc.\nQuestionable whether this was started before admission.  Patient\ncontinues to have distended abdomen.  CT read by radiolists at\n[**Hospital1 18**] reveal no signs of obstruction or surgical conditions.\nWas sent for cDiff toxins from the ICU and was started on p.o.\nvanc with i.v. Flagyl on [**6-1**].  cDiff toxins sent at [**Hospital1 18**]\nreturned negative value and p.o. vanc and i.v. Flagyl were\ndiscontinued.\n\n# Hypoxia- Read as possible PNA here in ED.  CXR by radiology\nhere read as more likely atelectasis than PNA.  CT abdomen also\nshows evidence of chronic aspiration at both lung bases.  Due to\nleukocytosis, hypoxia, and these radiological findings, cannot\nrule out PNA.  Was started on broad coverage with\nvanc/cefepime/Flagyl in ED.  Was not in respiratory distress or\nhypoxic while in the ICU.  CXR more consistent with atelectasis\nthan PNA.  These were stopped on [**6-1**] in the MICU due to low\nconcern for PNA, more in line with picture of aspiration\npneumonitis. Patient had one episode of desaturation into 92-93%\ns/p vomiting while in hemodialysis  on [**6-5**], but returned to\n[**Location 213**] saturation once placed on 2L, he was asymptomatic during\nthis episode and his blood pressure stabilized. He continued to\ndo well and have normal saturation on the floor.\n\n#Esophageal Strictures - patient had esophageal strictures in\nthe past. Was evaluated here and underwent EGD with esophageal\ndilation. It was felt that he was not a candidate for stent. EGD\nreport as follows:\n=================================================\nA stricture that was 3-4 cm long and appeared at 35 cm from the\nincisors was seen. The pediatric upper endoscope scope traversed\nthe lesion. A 18FR [**Last Name (un) 17407**] dilator was introduced for dilation\nand the diameter was progressively increased to 24 FR\nsuccessfully.\n Mucosa: Esophagitis was seen in the lower third of the\nesophagus and middle third of the esophagus, compatible with\nerosive esophagitis. A salmon colored mucosa distributed in a\nextensive pattern, suggestive of [**Last Name (un) 15532**]'s Esophagus was found.\nThe Z-line was at 33 cm from the incisors and the upper end of\nthe gastric folds started at 37 cm from the incisors.\nStomach:\n Other A PEG tube was seen in the stomach, extending towards the\npylorus.\nDuodenum: Not examined.\nImpression: Esophageal stricture in lower third of esophagus,\nlikely related to severe reflux disease.  Evidence of erosive\nesophagitis and [**Last Name (un) 15532**]'s.\nSuccessful [**Last Name (un) **] dilation to 24Fr.\nThis patient was not felt to be a candidate for an esophageal\nstent because of his benign stricture, active erosive\nesophagitis. There is a high likelihood of recurrent stricture\ndespite stent placement, and management of such a stricture is\nsignificantly limited after placement of a stent.\n\nRecommendations: This patient should be on maximum acid\nsuppression (40mg [**Hospital1 **] omeprazole) for severe erosive esophagitis\nand evidence of [**Hospital1 15532**]'s.\nAspiration precautions: raise head of bed, small frequent meals.\n\nFollow-up with refering physicians as already scheduled.\nConsider multiple biospies of [**Hospital1 15532**]'s esophagus once patient\nhas been on maximal acid suppression for at leat 8 weeks.\n=====================================================\n\n# Hypotension- BP 82/53 at triage.  Could be [**12-24**] to sepsis or\nhypovolemia.  BP responded to 2L of fluids in the ED.  Blood\ncultures were sent and were negative.  Resolved in the ICU. Was\nstable on the floor for the rest of the hospital stay.\n\n# ESRD- on HD, has been given fluids to maintain pressures, no\nelectrolyte abnormalities at present, Cr at 4.8 (unclear\nbaseline).  on dialysis M/W/F per written records from OSH.\nReceived HD while in hospital.\n\n# Elevated troponins- Patient found to have elevated troponins\nto 0.23 in the ED.  CK-MB was normal.  EKG showed no evidence of\nacute cardiac events.

Due to concerns for\nrespiratory status, she was admitted to the neurological ICU for\nclose observation.\n.\nNeuro\nShe underwent frequent neuro checks for keeping an eye on\nprogression of symptoms of myasthenia. She did not have any\ncholinergic symptoms , thus excluding cholenergic crisis as\npossible cause. She was continued on outpatient doses of\nprednisone and azothioprine. She was started on IVIG in dose of\n2 gm/kg, divided over 4 days. She showed mild subjective as well\nas objective improvement in strength after initiation of IVIG,\nbut her respiratory status remained tenuous.  After this, she\ncompleted a three day course of high-dose steroids\n(methylprednisolone 1000 mg daily) without significant change in\nexamination.  After this, her daily prednisone dose was\nincreased to 60 mg and she underwent five courses of\nplasmapheresis.  During this time she had a slow but steady\nimprovement in her respiratory function and strength.  Her\ndiplopia resolved, neck flexors and extensors as well as\nproximal muscles improved to 4+/5.  Her NIF and VC improved\nsignificantly (-80 and 1.2 L at time of discharge).\n.\nResp\nShe underwent initially Q2H, monitering of mechanics including\nNIF and VC. After staring IVIg she steadily showed improvement\nfrom values as low as -30 /650 to -80 / 1.4 L. The apparently\nlow values disproportionate to clinical status were though to be\nresult of tracheomalacia. She underwent A line for checking\nABGs.  She transiently required BiPAP during sleep due to\ntachypnea and rising pCO2.  She did not require intubation\nduring the hospital course and had been doing well on room air\nat the time of discharge, and able to count to 40 in one breath.\n.\nCards\nShe was constantly monitered on telemetry. She was noted to have\natrial fibrilation during the hospital stay on [**6-6**] night. This\nwas preceded by placement of a central line which was thought to\nhave possibly provoked the incident. She was evaluated by\ncardiology, was started on IV amiodarone and IV heparin was\nstarted. She converted back to sinus within 24 hrs.  Amiodarone\nwas switched to PO in dose of 400 mg [**Hospital1 **] and was advised to\nswitch to 200 mg daiy after a period of 2 weeks.  She underwent\nTTE which showed EF of 30-35 percent.  In view of DM, and CHF,\nshe was continued on heparin with goal PTT 50-70.  She was\nstarted on coumadin once plasmapheresis was completed with goal\nINR [**1-25**].  As she had been chemically cardioverted,\nanticoagulation for at least one month was recommended by\ncardiology.  She was monitored on telemetry throughout the\nhospitalization and was in normal sinus rhythm from [**6-8**] through\ntime of discharge ([**6-20**]).  On [**2141-6-23**] INR was 1.3.  Patient will\nhave outpatient follow up in [**Hospital 197**] clinic on [**2141-6-27**].\nHematology\nThe patient developed a slow drift in all cell lines (WBC,\nhematocrit, and platelets) during the hospital course.  As her\nplatelets dropped to a nadir of 130 while on heparin, HIT\nantibody was checked and was negative.  Her hematocrit dropped\nto a nadir of 22.5 and the patient had multiple ecchymoses\nthroughout her body.  Hemolysis labs were unremarkable and stool\nguaiacs were negative.  CT abdomen and pelvis showed no evidence\nof retroperitoneal hematoma.  It was thought the pancytopenia\nmay have been a late result of her IVIG infusions earlier in the\nhospital course.  She received a total of 2 units pRBCs due to\npresumed symptomatic anemia (lightheadedness on standing), and\nhematocrit remained stable after transfusion (27-30) at the time\nof discharge.\n.\nVascular\nThe patient was found to have a left thigh ecchymosis on [**6-20**] PM\nas well as bilateral foot edema, L\u003eR.  Concern was highest for\nhematoma due to recent removal of left femoral central line the\nday prior, although DVT was also considered.  A LLE ultrasound\nis currently pending.  The patient's hematocrit has been stable\nand is continuing to be monitored.\n.\nID\nThe patient remained afebrile throughout her hospital course.\nAt time of admission, routine infectious workup was negative.\nDuring the hospital course the patient was found to have a\nurinary tract infection, with urine Cx [**6-15**] growing klebsiella\npneumonia.  She completed a seven-day course of ciprofloxacin.\nOn [**6-17**], she was found to have small sores in her mouth, similar\nto prior HSV infections.  She was started on a 5-day course of\nacyclovir.\n.\nEndocrine\nThe patient was noted to have elevated fingersticks, ranging\nfrom low 100s to low 300s.  This was thought to be secondary to\nher increased steroid doses.  Her lantus was gradually increased\nup to 35 units daily and regular insulin sliding scale was used\nfor coverage during the day.\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\n1.

Was doing well at his group home when he\nwas noted to have about 5 two-minute petite mal seizures that\nresolved on their own. Was taken to OSH where he again had 2\nmore siezures, this time more tonic clonic. Was treated with 2\nmg ativan IV x1 and then valium 5 mg IV x1, and tegretol for\ncontinued seizing. He was found to have PNA on CXR and treated\nwith zosyn. He was transferred here because he gets his\nneurology care at [**Hospital1 18**].\n.\nIn the ED, initial vs were 98.4, 96/62, 72, 14, 98% NRB. Patient\nwas given vanco and levofloxacin here. He also got 1L NS. He was\nunable to be weaned from the non-rebreather, so admitted to the\nICU.

However as\nseen below there was not sufficient evidence for an pneumonia\nand it may have been a viral infection.  His phenytoin and\ncarbemazepine levels were at goal.  While in the MICU on [**2108-4-2**],\nhe had a [**Date Range 862**] lasting 13 minutes characterized by right eye\nand face twitching and associated with tachycardia to 140s and\nhypoxia to O2sat 70s.   He received ativan 1mg x 2.  He was then\nstarted on standing Ativan, initially 1mg Q6hr, and transferred\nto the Neurology service.  His Zonegran was increased to 500mg\nQHS, and his Dilantin was returned to his prior dose of\n150mg/200mg.  He remained [**Date Range 862**] free on [**4-3**], and the Ativan\nwas tapered further from 1mg q8hr to 0.5mg Q6hr.  He was doing\nwell until [**4-6**] his tube feeds stopped flowing and he was noted\nto have an ileus.  His medications were switched to IV form.  He\nhas a few seizures while on IV formulation and his ativan was\nbumped back to 1mg q6h.  His ileus resolved and he was placed\nback on his oral medications and his Zonegran was increased to\n500mg.  The ativan was tapered off and he was [**Month/Day (4) 862**] free at\ndischarge.\n.\n# Pneumonia: Found to have a new possible LLL pneumonia on CXR.\nAs patient does have a h/o MRSA infection and comes from a group\nhome setting, he was started on vancomycin, zosyn, and\nazithromycin for HCAP and CAP coverage.  He initially was on a\nnon-rebreather, but throughout the course of the day on [**4-2**] he\nwas titrated off all oxygen, and was back on room air by [**4-3**].\nRepeat CXR still showed no sign of pneumonia, the patient was\nafebrile, and WBC count had improved so antibiotics were stopped\non [**4-3**].  It was thought that the inciting factor this time was\npossible a viral upper respiratory tract infection, as there had\nbeen concern about increased congestion and cough during the\nweek prior to admission\n.\n# FEN: Tube feeds: patient was unable to tolerate tube feeds for\nseveral days as high residuals were noted. There was concern for\nmild ileus with a KUB showing Multiple air-filled dilated loops\nof small and large bowel. He was kept NPO for several days and\nthen tube feeds were resumed without any difficulty. He\ntolerated Fibersource HN Full strength at 45 ml/hr with minimal\nresiduals.

Another possibility\nconsidered was local ulceration (i.e. stercoral ulcer) from\nlong-term rectal balloon. Had EGD/[**Last Name (un) **] [**3-12**] that showed mild\ngastritis (none at 3rd portion of duodenum where there would be\nconcern for fistula) and a small ulceration in the rectum not\nactively bleeding. This was felt to be the cause of bleed. Hct\nremained stable over the course of hospitalization though had\nsome fluctuations, but he did have one transfusion. Aspirin was\nrestarted. Recent stools were guaiac negative.\n\nCHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE ANEMIA\nHad rectal bleed and is on epo as outpatient for Chronic Kidney\nDisease. He is on 20,000 units q week. Will cont to get epo as\noutpt.\n\n\nHEPARIN INDUCED THROMBOCYTOPENIA:\nHIT Ab neg at outside hospital. Had a nadir ~60,000 at OSH. HIT\nAb was tested at [**Hospital1 18**] and was positive. No heparin products\nwere administered. His platelets were monitored and returned to\n[**Location 213**] limits. AVOID ALL HEPARIN PRODUCTS/FLUSHES\n\nURINARY TRACT INFECTION WITH HIGHLY RESISTANT PSEUDOMONAS AND E.\nCOLI:\nPt was febrile to 100 initially in the hospital. He was started\non ciproflox for UTI. He was treated with vanc and zosyn at the\nOSH was an unknown duration of time. Blood cx sent here were\nnegative but urine culture grew highly resistant pseudomonas and\ne. coli. Additionally, he had an infected wound seroma also with\nhighly resistant e. coli. He was started on aztreonam as below.\n\n  F/U CULTURE WITH ASYMPTOMATIC BACTURIA/VRE\n  Follow-up UA was negative, but culture was positive for\n10K-100K of Vancomycin\n  Resistant Enterococcus. This might represent colonization\ngiven that his u/a was\n  negative and that he had no symptoms. This was sensitive to\nlinezolid, which\n  should be started should he develop any fever or urinary\nsymptoms.\n\n\n\nLEFT FEMORAL SURGICAL WOUND INFECTION/SEROMA\nGrowing highly resistant e. coli, ID and vascular surgery\nreviewed CT and the infection does not appear to be contiguous\nwith the graft.\nStarted on Aztreonam to complete 14 day course.\n\nELBOW PAIN/CELLULITIS/TENDONITIS\nThe patient began to complain of red/swollen/painful left elbow.\nHe had gout in the elbow previously, but his focal pain seemed\nto be outside of the joint. Physical exam demonstrated no\narticular pain but pain more at the triceps insertion. There was\nan initial area of crepitace around that area. Ultrasound\ndemonstrated no clot. The bursa was tapped with negative culture\nand insufficient fluid for cell count. XRay demonstrated only\nsoft tissue swelling. He began, in consultation with ID, a 14\nday course of vancomycin for presumed cellulitis with\nimprovement.\n\n\nDELIRIUM:\nThe patient had AMS since extubation at OSH. He demonstrated\ndelirium over the first few days of admission. He had been bed\nbound with little activity for a month. His benadryl for skin\nrash was discontinued. Most likely his delerium multifactorial\nincluding medication and toxic-metabolic etiologies. No focal\nneuro deficit was noted. MS improved over the hospital course.\nHe should not take benadryl.\n\n1ST DEGREE ATRIOVENTRICULAR BLOCK, NEW, R/O ENDOCARDITIS\nThe patient was noted to have a prolonged PR on ECG obtained\nbecause of sinus tachycardia. This was new from admission. Given\nthe history of viridans bacteremia at the referring hospital,\nechocardiograms were obtained to evaluate for perivalvular\nabscess. Blood cultures remained negative throughout his\nhospitalization but he had intermittently received antibiotics.\nElectrophysiology and cardiology consultations were obtained.\nThe AV delay was thought to be due to dual tracts within the AV\nnode; when the patient was tachycardic, the slow AV pathway\nsuperceded the fast AV pathway.\n\n2ND DEGREE ATIOVENTRICULAR BLOCK / OSA\nThe patient had dropped beats on telemtry and was found to have\nat least two periods where he had nonconducted p waves x3 and\nhad ventricular escape. EP thought this was most likely vagal\nsurge in setting of obstructive sleep apnea (these occured at\nnight) and recommended sleep study.\nCardiology/EP stated that it was safe to restart beta blockers.\n\nDEPRESSION:\nSW saw frequently and he was continued on outpatient\nmedications.\n\nDESQUAMATING DRUG RASH:\nHistorically, this was related to Pip-Tazo. It was primarily\nmaculopapular and pruritic and later became desquamating, and\naffected arms, trunk, and legs. Sarna was continued for\npruritis. Triamcinolone cream  was continued.\n\nDIABETES:\nPt was uptitrated on lantus to 17units daily, including an\ninsulin sliding scale.\n\nCAD s/p stent [**2146**]:\nAspirin was held given the GI bleed. It was restarted after the\nEGD did not show any soruce of bleeding. He was on IV metoprolol\ninitially. He was switched to metoprolol 25 po BID. Simvastatin\nwas started.\n\nCKD: Cr was slightly up, likely prerenal from skin losses,\nimproved w/ 1LNS\nOf note, he had unilateral renal infarction following his AAA\nrepair\n\nAAA Repair: Pt was followed by vascular surgery here.\nHe has a follow-up appointment wtih Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 77954**] in [**Month (only) 547**].\n\nFEN: Mech soft diabetic diet w/ thin liquids, sugar free health\nshakes\n\nCode: FULL\n\nCommunication: HCP wife [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 69502**] h [**Telephone/Fax (1) 77955**] c\n[**Telephone/Fax (1) 77956**]\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nEpo 20K qWk\ntylenol needed\nbenadryl prn\nMOM\nbudesonide 0.5 IH [**Hospital1 **]\nASA 325 daily\nlopressor 25mg PO BID\nacyclovir cream TP QID x 1wk\nativan prn\nhydralazine 10 q6 prn\nRISS\ntriamcinolone 0.1% cream TP [**Hospital1 **]\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.

Upon\nadmission he was appropriately medically managed, including\nmultiple antibiotics and underwent extensive pre-operative\nwork-up. This included usual lab work, echo, head ct and\nconsultations for renal, ID, cardiology and neurology. In\naddition wound care specialist saw Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 88608**] for a coccyx\npressure ulcer pre and postoperatively. All consulted services\nfollowed him throughout his hospital course. On [**5-1**] he was\nbrought to the operating room where he underwent an aortic valve\nreplacement, mitral valve repair, and coronary artery bypass\ngraft x 4. Please see operative report for surgical details.\nFollowing surgery he was transferred to the CVICU for invasive\nmonitoring in critical but stable condition. Hemodynamics were\naugmented via pressors and inotropic support for several days\nimmediately postop due to cardiogenic shock.  Antibiotics for\nhis endocarditis were recommended by ID. Per Renal\nrecommendations CVVH was initiated until hemodynamics could\ntolerate HD. Mr.[**Known lastname 88609**] remained intubated until POD#6 due to\nvolume overload. CVVH was discontinued and peritoneal dialysis\nwas resumed. [**5-8**], pacing wires were discontinued,\nanticoagulation was initiated for his mechanical valve. He had\nan episode of VFib in which he was defibrillated and placed on\nan Amiodarone drip. Once weaned off all pressors and inotropy,\nbeta-blocker/Statin and Aspirin were started. Postoperatively he\nhad a persistent leukocytosis for which all lines were changed\nand he was repeatedly pan cultured. ID continued to follow.  OR\ntissue culture showed no growth.  No source identified for his\nelevated white count.\nMr.[**Known lastname 88609**] had some agitation, confusion, and  hallucinations\npostoperatively in which he was given Haldol. His mental status\nreturned to baseline. He continued to slowly progress and on\n[**5-12**] he was transferred to the step down unit for further\nmonitoring. Due to his deconditioning, Physical Therapy was\nconsulted for evaluation of strength and mobility. ID/Renal/and\nthe wound care consults followed with recommendations until\nDr.[**First Name (STitle) **] cleared him for discharge on POD#17.

[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 406**] drain was placed in the\nretroperitoneum. Surgeon was Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. Please refer to\noperative note for details. Postop, he remained in the PACU for\nmanagement of low bp and urine output. Neo was required for low\nsbp. He was transferred to the SICU for continued management.\n\nU/S on [**9-23**] showed mild hydro, mildly increased RIs, mildly\ndelayed aterial upstrokes. Urine output was 5-10cc/hr. CVVH was\nstarted for hyperkalemia after femoral CVL was exchanged for a\ntemporary line.\nOn [**9-24**] he was febrile to 101.6 likely from ATG. However, he was\npan-cultured. The L femoral line was removed. He was transiently\nhypoxic, likely from atelectasis. CXR showed bilateral\ninfiltrates, poor respiratory status likely [**1-23**] fluid overload.\nHe was given 1 unit of PRBC for hct of 25.1 from 31.\n\nOn [**9-25**]  Hemodialysis was done with 2 units of PRBCs given for\nhct of 25.2. He was weaned to O2 via nasal cannula.\n\nUrine output was less than 500cc/day. Creatinine remained\nelevated, dropping after HD as expected. JP drainage decreased\nand JP was removed on [**9-26**]. Incision was intact with staples and\nremained without redness/drainage.\n\nDiet was advanced and tolerated. Immunosuppression consisted of\nATG x 4 doses (125mg each dose), Cellcept 1 gram [**Hospital1 **], steroids\nwere tapered to off and prograf was started on postop day 1.\nDoses were adjusted per trough levels.\n\nHe was assisted to ambulate. PT recommended return to his home\nskilled nursing facilty.\n\nThe patient was also followed by Transplant Nephrology, who\nmonitored his need for hemodialysis. On HD 11 the patient was\nnoted to have increased urine output to 1040 mls. And creatinine\ndid not rise as quickly interdialytically. He was given PO lasix\nand the nephrologists plan is to follow labs and volume status\nto determine need for future hemodialysis. On [**10-2**], the\ncreatinine was noted to have fallen to 3.7, which was the first\ndrop in this value without dialysis intervention. He is also\ncontinuing to make  greater than a liter of urine daily.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nmodafanil 100 mg PO daliy, omeprazole 20 mg PO daily, ASA\n325 mg, advair 100-50 1 puff [**Hospital1 **], fibra-lax 625 mg PO BID,\nhydralazine 50 mg PO BID 3x/wk and TID 4 x/week, renvela 2400 mg\nTID, Ca acetate 1334 mg TID, metoclopramid 5 mg QID, atenolol\n100\nmg PO daily, simvastatin 20 mg PO daily, amlodipine 10 mg PO\ndaily (hold in dialysis days), pregabalin 25 mg PO daily,\nsensipar 60 mg PO daily, sertraline 200 mg daily, folic acid 0.8\nmg daily, trazadone 100 mg PO qhs, risperidone 1.5 mg PO qhs,\ntylenol, lantus 25 units SQ daily, bowel regimen (Milk of mag,\nbiscodyl, fleet enema, Mg citrate)\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1. nystatin 100,000 unit/mL Suspension Sig: Five (5) ML PO QID\n(4 times a day).\n2. docusate sodium 50 mg/5 mL Liquid Sig: One (1)  PO BID (2\ntimes a day).\n3. fluticasone-salmeterol 100-50 mcg/dose Disk with Device Sig:\nOne (1) Disk with Device Inhalation [**Hospital1 **] (2 times a day).\n4. risperidone 1 mg/mL Solution Sig: 1.5 mg PO HS (at bedtime).\n\n5. sertraline 50 mg Tablet Sig: Four (4) Tablet PO DAILY\n(Daily).\n6. omeprazole 20 mg Capsule, Delayed Release(E.C.)

At that time he was found to be in ARF\nw/elevated CK, and had \"evidence of CHF and COPD flare\" as well\nas pancytopenia with 15% blasts. Here he was initially in the\n[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for hypoxia (93% on RA) and concern for blast crisis. He\ndid well, tolerated fluid resuscitation, and did not require\nintubation. He was seen by Heme-Onc, who felt he did not have\nAML but had Myelodysplasia with excess blasts. His renal failure\nresolved with hydration (0.8 on d/c, from 2.1). Per the family's\nrequest, he was transferred back to [**Location (un) **] on [**7-4**], and was\ndischarged to home from there on [**7-5**]. He finished a course of\nantibiotics on [**7-6**].\n\nHe was discharged home on 2 liters oxygen although he had not\nbeen on this prior. He was doing well post-d/c per his daughter,\nbut over the past few days has been more lethargic, decreased po\nintake, increasing shortness of breath. He was febrile to 102\nlast pm. His mental status remained at baseline (alert,\noriented, interactive) with the exception of one episode of\nconfusion last pm which resolved within minutes. He has no\ndysuria but per the daughter has had diarrhea and urinary/fecal\nincontinence over the past 3-4 weeks with inability to tell when\nhe is stooling or urinating. He had no focal weakness, nausea,\nvomiting, abdominal pain, cough, or other symptoms.\n\nAt the OSH ED, he was tachypneic in 40s with o2 sat 80s, and was\nplaced on bipap.

For the purposes of this dictation, the\nmost inferior disk will be referred to as S1/2, and the\ntransitional vertebra will be referred to as partially\nlumbarized S1.\n\nBone marrow signal is diffusely abnormal, consistent with\ndiffuse bone infiltration by tumor. There is a suggestion of\ncortical destruction in the posterior inferior endplate of L3,\nposterior superior endplate of L4, posterior inferior endplate\nof L5, and posterior superior endplate of S1. Mild compression\ndeformities are seen in all of the visualized vertebrae from T12\nthrough S1, likely secondary to pathologic fractures. There is\nno bone marrow edema on the STIR images to suggest that these\nfractures are acute. The conus terminates at L1. No compression\nof the conus is noted.\n\nAt L3/4, there is a disc bulge and a more focal right\nparacentral herniation, which displaces the nerve roots medially\nand posteriorly. In addition, there is a shallow, small epidural\nmass extending from the posterior vertebral body into the right\nneural foramen, which may represent epidural tumor or a mottled\nosteophyte- CT could provide differentiation between the two\netiologies.\nThere is only mild associated narrowing of the right neural\nforamen.\n\nAt L4/5, there is facet spondylosis and a disc bulge with mild\nassociated central stenosis and lateral recess narrowing\nbilaterally.\n\nAt L5/S1, there is a disc bulge and facet spondylosis with mild\ncentral stenosis and bilateral lateral recess narrowing.\n\nLenticular epidural structures are noted extending from L3\nthrough L5 posterior to the vertebral bodies and anterior to the\nthecal sac, with high signal on T1- and T2-weighted images.\nThese likely represent epidural fat, and less likely distended\nepidural veins. This appearance is not consistent with epidural\ntumor.\n\nThe following preliminary report was given by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] to a\nresident caring for the patient at 12:30 a.m. on [**2136-7-25**]:\nAbnormal signal in vertebral bodies. Disc herniation impinging\non the thecal sac on the right at L3/4. No spinal cord\ncompression.\n\nThe final report was discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9570**] at 1:45 p.m. on\n[**2136-7-25**].\n\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Diffuse bone marrow infiltration by tumor, with probable\ncortex destruction at multiple levels. Probable epidural\nextension of tumor into the right L3/4 neural foramen with mild\nforamen narrowing.\n2. Small right paracentral disc herniation at L3/4, which\ndisplaces the nerve roots.\n3. Mild central stenosis and lateral recess narrowing at L4/5\nand L5/S1.\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nA/P:\n1. Hypotension:  Patient was likely hypotensive from dehydration\nsecondary to diarrhea.  Once he was fluid resucitated his BP\nreturned to [**Location 213**].  He was then normotensive for the remainder\nof the admission.  Cortisol stim test was normal.  Anti HTN meds\nwere held.\n\n2. Fever/Diarrhea:  [**Month (only) 116**] be related in that patient has c.diff\nfrom recent Abx course and profound diarrhea.  C diff was neg x\n2 but patient was treated with empiric flagyl.  Sent home to\ncomplete a 14 day course.  Rectal tube placed in MICU.  By the\nthird day the diarrhea had resolved (either spontaneously or due\nto the flagyl).  He had no diarrhea for the rest of the\nadmission.\n\n3. Urinary and bowel incontinence:  Patint was incontinent of\nurine and feces during the admission.  By report of his family\nthe urine is baseline for the patient since his radical\nprostatectomy.  The stool was likely due to the diarrhea.\nHowever it was noted that the patient had poor rectal tone.\nThere were no other neurological findings.  An MRI was negative\nfor nerve impingement or cord compression.\n\n4. Myelodysplasia:h/o MDS with xs blasts.  Patient evaluated by\nHeme/Onc.  Transfused to Hct \u003e 28.  Patient will have Heme Onc\nFollow up in [**Location (un) **] with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 402**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].\n\n5. Prostate Cancer - patient with negative PSA.

The patient has required\nTPN via PICC line while undergoing tube feed advancement\ngiven underlying gastroparesis.\n\nThe patient has been unable to tolerate rapid advancement in\ntube feeds secondary to increased nausea.  The patient's PICC\nline reportedly was lost recently, and given the patient's\ninability to tolerate tube feeds, the patient was transferred\nfor PICC line placement for reinitiation of TPN.\n\nThe patient reported that he had essentially been in his\nusual state of health with the exception of increased nausea.\nHe did note that he has had frequent nonbloody, nonmelanotic\nstools over the two days prior to transfer.  The patient\ndenied abdominal pain, vomiting, chest pain, shortness of\nbreath, as well as cough.  The patient also denied recent\nantibiotics.\n\nThe patient is aneuric and on hemodialysis Monday, Wednesday\nand Friday.\n\nIn the Emergency Department, the patient was noted to have a\npotassium of 6.3 (without electrocardiogram changes), a\ntemperature of 100.6??????, and white blood cell count of 17.  The\npatient received Kayexalate 30 mg with subsequent emesis.\nThe patient responded to a second dose of Kayexalate with\nlarge stool.  Blood cultures, as well as sputum cultures were\nsent from the Emergency Department, and no antibiotics were\ngiven.\n\nThe patient was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit\nfor management pending PICC placement.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Polycystic kidney disease,\ncomplicated by end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis\nMonday, Wednesday and Friday since [**2171**].  2.  History of\nbacterial endocarditis complicated by mitral valve\nreplacement and perivalvular abscess.  3.  Hypertension.  4.\nPeptic ulcer disease.  5.

General:  The patient was\nawake and responsive to verbal commands.  HEENT:  Extraocular\nmovements intact bilaterally.  Pupils equal, round and\nreactive to light and accommodation.  Moist mucous membranes.\nNeck:  Trach in place.  Supple.  No lymphadenopathy.\nCardiovascular:  Regular, rate and rhythm.  Normal S1 and S2.\nNo murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Pulmonary:  Coarse breath\nsounds with good aeration.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender,\nnondistended.  With midline perpendicular scar with ventral\nhernia, reducible (NG tube in place).  Extremities:  Warm.\nNo edema.  Large scrotal edema (nontense).  There were 2+\ndorsalis pedis pulses and posterior tibial pulses.\nNeurological:  Awake and alert.  Responding to verbal\ncommands with mouthed verbal response.\n\nLABORATORY DATA:  On admission CBC was with a white blood\ncell count of 17.8, hematocrit 35.2, platelet count 719, with\na white blood cell differential of 86 polys, 2 lymphs, 9\nmonos, 3 eosinophils; CHEM7 with a sodium of 135, potassium\n6.3, chloride 94, bicarb 19, BUN 91, creatinine 5.0, glucose\n65; coags with a PT of 19.8, PTT 42.3, INR 2.6; calcium 11.4,\nphosphorus 6.8, magnesium 2.0.\n\nChest x-ray on admission showed patchy opacities in the right\nupper lobe, right basilar and lingular regions.\n\nElectrocardiogram on admission normal sinus rhythm at 90 with\nleft atrial dilatation, T-wave inversions in leads I, AVL,\nV4-V6, and delayed R-wave progression (unchanged from prior\nelectrocardiogram).\n\nEchocardiogram from [**2187-12-5**] with mild symmetric left\nventricular hypertrophy, overall left systolic function\nmildly depressed with mild 1+ mitral regurgitation and no\npericardial effusion.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was transferred from\nrehabilitation with the purpose of PICC line placement.  The\npatient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit given his\nventilator dependence.\n\nOn admission, the patient was noted to have a low-grade fever\nand elevated white count with multiple patchy opacities on\nchest x-ray.  Unfortunately, it was unclear on transfer that\nthe patient had been on recent antibiotics (Cephalosporin and\nVancomycin) for elevated white blood cell count to 35 and\npresumed pulmonary process, as well as possible C-difficile\ninfection.  It was unclear if the patient had completed his\nintended antibiotic course.\n\nFurthermore, the patient was later noted to have Methicillin\nresistant Staphylococcus aureus in his sputum culture from\n[**2-20**].  As the team was made aware of this, the patient\nwas placed on precautions for likely MRSA colonization.\n\nGiven the concern for infection, the PICC line placement was\ndeferred.  Blood cultures and sputum cultures were sent from\nthe Emergency Department; however, empiric antibiotics were\nheld secondary to an unknown source of infection.  The\npatient was continued on his outpatient medications with the\nexception of PhosLo secondary to elevated phosphate.\n\nThe patient underwent routine hemodialysis on [**2-25**] with 2\nkg removed.  Posthemodialysis, a repeat chest x-ray\ndemonstrated resolution of the pulmonary opacities\n(presumably fluid) with minimal bibasilar atelectasis.\n\nThe patient remained afebrile on hospital day #1 without\ncomplaints or evidence of occult infection.  The patient's\noxygenation and ventilation remained stable on his outpatient\nventilator settings.\n\nIn order to further evaluate the potential sources of\ninfection, a renal ultrasound was obtained on [**2-25**] to\nevaluate for potential hydronephrosis or renal abscess.\nGiven the patient's underlying renal disease, the study was\nuninterpretable with evidence of grossly calcified and cystic\nkidneys.  However, on renal ultrasound, sludge was noted in\nthe gallbladder with increased gallbladder wall thickness.\n\nLiver function tests were obtained with evidence of elevated\nalkaline phosphatase of 998 with a high normal total\nbilirubin of 1.5.  A right upper quadrant ultrasound was\nperformed which demonstrated multiple liver cysts; however,\nno evidence for intrahepatic ductal dilatation or common bile\nduct dilatation.\n\nThe gallbladder demonstrated evidence of sludge and stones\nwith increased wall thickness; however, compared with\nprevious right upper quadrant ultrasound studies, as well as\nCAT scans, the appearance of the gallbladder was felt to be\nunchanged.  Of note, the patient was without abdominal pain;\nhowever, given the patient's history of nausea and diarrhea,\n\nit may be reasonable to consider that the patient's elevated\nwhite count and symptoms were due to acalculous\ncholecystitis, now resolving.  The patient's white blood cell\ncount on hospital day #2 trended down to 12 from 17.  The\npatient continued without evidence of infection, and a PICC\nline was placed by Interventional Radiology on hospital day\n#2.\n\nThe patient was restarted on tube feeds at 10 cc/hr.  A\nNutrition consult was obtained with recommendations to start\nstandard TPN day #1 with low phosphate (with 150 mg dextrose\nand 70 g amino acids) at a goal rate of 85 cc/hr.\n\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.\n\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d., Reglan 10\nmg p.o. q.i.d., Coumadin 2 mg p.o. q.d., Synthroid 100 mcg\np.o. q.d., Albuterol and Atrovent nebs p.r.n., Epogen 1500 U\nq.hemodialysis, Paxil 30 mg p.o. q.d., Fentanyl transdermal\n25 mcg/hr q.72 hours, Nifedipine 40 mg q.6 hours, Lisinopril\n20 mg p.o. q.d., Atenolol 100 mg p.o. q.d., Ativan 0.25 mg\nq.8 hours p.r.n., Zofran 4 mg p.r.n. q.8 hours.\n\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:\n1.

He was take directly to the operating room where he\nunderwent coronary artery bypass grafting to two vessels and a\nmitral valve repair with a 28mm annuloplasty band.\nPostoperatively he was taken to the cardiac surgical intensive\ncare unit for monitoring. On postoperative day one, Mr. [**Known lastname 38315**] [**Last Name (Titles) **]e neurologically intact and was extubated. The\nelectrophysiology service was consulted for assistance with\nchanges to his pacemaker. Good lead function was noted. Mr.\n[**Known lastname 38315**] developed respiratory distress and was reintubated.\nVancomycin and levofloxacin was started for presumed aspiration.\nLasix was given intravenously for pulmonary edema and natrecor\nwas started. He was transfused for postoperative anemia. He\nunderwent CVVH to assist with fluid management. On postoperative\nday five, he was re-extubated successfully without complication.\nThe physical therapy service worked with him postoperatively to\nimprove his strength and mobility. Mr. [**Known lastname 38315**] complained of\nright 5th digit pain and an x-ray was obtained. This revealed a\nfracture and a splint was applied. His natrecor and milrinone\nwere slowly weaned. An ace inhibitor was started given his low\nejection fraction. On postoperative day 14, Mr. [**Known lastname 38315**] was\ntransferred to the step down unit for further recovery.\nAmiodarone was started for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.\nCoumadin was resumed. He continued to be gently diuresed towards\nhis preoperative weight. His creatinine bumped and the renal\nservice was consulted. A foley was placed and he was transferred\nback to the intensive care unit for 1 day. His ace inhibitor was\nstopped as well as lasix. Acute renal failure was suspected in\nthe setting of an ace inhibitor, diuretics and dehydration. Over\nthe next few days, his creatinine stabilized and began to trend\nback towards normal. His foley was removed and a flomax was\nstarted for some frequency, hesitancy and urgency with good\nrelief. Mr. [**Known lastname 104792**] coumadin was held as his INR was elevated\nto 4.2. Vitamin K was also given as he developed a nose bleed.\nThe Ear, nose and throat service was consulted who recommended\nsaline mist nasal sprays twice daily. His epistaxis subsequently\nresolved. Mr. [**Known lastname 38315**] continued to make steady progress and was\ndischarged to rehabilitation on postoperative day twenty one.\nHis INR was 4.0 on discharge and his coumadin remains held. Dr.\n[**Last Name (STitle) 1270**] will manage his coumadin after discharge from rehab\nfor a goal INR of 1.8-2.2. His room air saturations were 98% and\nhis discharge x-ray was only notable for a very small left\npleural effusion.

Found to be\nhyperthyroid and subsequently developed right foot drop.\n\nACTIVE PROBLEMS:\n#Atrial fibrillation/flutter: Patient has long standing history\nof atrial fibrillation and flutter with multiple failed\nablations in [**2153**] and [**2155**]. Presented in AFib with RVR leading\nto impressive volume overload and respiratory distress. Patient\nwas placed on BiPap on admission to hospital. Rate was\ncontrolled initially with IV diltiazem before maintenance\ncontrol with diltiazem 150 po qid. Rate was maintained in the\n90's during most of his hospitalization. Volume overload was\ninitially treated with IV lasix, but as patient is ESRD and\n[**Year (4 digits) 2286**] dependent, volume control was ultimately achieved with\nmultiple [**Year (4 digits) 2286**] sessions. Patient was transferred to the floor\non [**8-18**] after successful rate control and diuresis, and patient\nhad no 02 requirement. Patient has CHADS-2 score of 3, but is\nmaintained on [**Month/Day (1) **] prophylaxis due to history of GI bleed.\nPatient was discharged to rehabilitation on diltiazem short\nacting 150mg qid and [**Month/Day (1) **] with follow up in cardiology clinic on\n[**9-4**] with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**].\n\n#CHF: Last echo on [**2158-7-5**] showed mild symmetric left\nventricular hypertrophy with mild global hypokinesis\n(40-45%LVEF). Patient was continued on lisinopril 20, and HD for\nvolume control.\n\n#Hyperthyroidism: Patient first noted to be hyperthyroid during\nhospitalization in late [**2158-7-14**], likely due to amiodarone,\nwhich the patient took from [**2155**]-[**2158-5-14**]. Endocrine was\nconsulted, and patient was started on methimazole 20 daily. ALP\nwas monitored following initiation of methimazole, and it did\nnot significantly increase. Additionally thyroid US was\nperformed which showed no nodules or increased blood flow.\nIodide levels were pending at the time of writing. Patient is to\ncontinue taking methimazole on discharge and follow up in\nendocrine clinic on [**2158-8-30**].\n\n# Right foot paralysis: On [**8-16**], the patient first complained of\nnew onset right lower extremity calf pain. He denied having any\ntrauma to the area. An US was negative for DVT. An ankle x-ray\nwas performed on [**8-17**] which revealed no acute fracture or\ndislocation. Patient then noted dense sensory loss of right foot\nlate on [**8-17**] with loss of plantar and dorsiflexion of ankle. Hip\nand knee flexors were intact. BP cuff was noted to be on his\nright thigh. Neurology was consulted who suspected compressive\nsciatic nerve neuropathy. MRI of lumbar spine showed no evidence\nof mass or cauda equina syndrome. Patient continued to have\ndifficulty moving foot on discharge to rehab.\n\n#DM: Patient with longstanding history of insulin dependent\ndiabetes. His home regiment included 16 units lantus with\nhumolog SS with meals. On admission he was placed on 12 units\nlantus with ISS. His blood sugars ran high throughout his\nadmission into the 200's and his lantus was increased to its\nhome dose of 16 units along with uptitration of ISS. Of note,\nhis blood sugar was \u003e400 on morning of admission, but there was\nnot documentation of him recieving his pm Lantus. Patient was\ncontinued on lisinopril 20 and atorvastatin 20 durin his\nhospitalization.\n\n#ESRD: Patient with history of end stage renal disease likely\ndue to diabetes. [**Month/Day (4) **] dependent for several years on\nTuesday, Thursday, Friday schedule. Access is with AV fistula in\nhis left arm. Patient received emergent [**Month/Day (4) 2286**] day of\nadmission for hypervolemia due to afib with RVR and subsequent\nrespiratory distress.

We found that you had gone back into an\nabnormal heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation causing your\nheart to beat so fast it couldn't effectively pump blood to your\nbody.  We think one reason this keeps happening is because your\nthyroid levels are too high.  We slowed down your heart rate\nwith medications and removed the fluid that was filling your\nlungs and legs with hemodialysis.  We also started a medication\nto decrease the amount of hormone your thyroid makes.  Finally,\nbefore you left, you started having trouble moving your right\nfoot. We think this is because a nerve in your leg was\ncompressed while you were laying in bed.\n\nYou will be going to a rehabilitation facility to help increase\nyour mobility. Please attend the following appointments we have\nscheduled for you, including appointments with endocrinologists\n(thyroid doctors) and nephrologists (kidney doctors). Note the\nfollowing changes to your medications:\n\nSTART Methimazole 20mg daily\nSTART diphenhydramine (benadryl) 25-50mg up to 3 times a day for\nitching\nINCREASE sevelamer to 4 tablets with meals daily\nINCREASE gabapentin to 300 mg at night\nINCREASE your lantus (long acting insulin) to 16 units at night\nCHANGE Diltiazem to 150mg four times a day\n\nPlease taking the remainder of your medications as previously\nprescribed. It has been a pleasure taking care of you.\n\nFollowup Instructions:\nDepartment: [**Hospital3 249**]\nWhen: MONDAY [**2158-8-28**] at 9:30 AM\nWith: [**Name6 (MD) **] [**Name8 (MD) **], MD [**Telephone/Fax (1) 250**]\nBuilding: [**Hospital6 29**] [**Location (un) **]\nCampus: EAST     Best Parking: [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Garage\n\nDepartment: MEDICAL SPECIALTIES\nWhen: WEDNESDAY [**2158-8-30**] at 3:00 PM\nWith: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2164**], MD [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1803**]\nBuilding: SC [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Clinical Ctr [**Location (un) **]\nCampus: EAST     Best Parking: [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Garage\n\nDepartment: CARDIAC SERVICES\nWhen: MONDAY [**2158-9-4**] at 10:00 AM\nWith: DR.

No son[**Name (NI) 493**] evidence of\nrenal stone,\nalthough CT is more sensitive.\n.\nTTE  [**2115-1-31**]\nThe left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately\ndilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.\nThe estimated right atrial pressure is at least 15 mmHg. There\nis mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left\nventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular\nsystolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25 %) with\nakinesis to dyskinesis of the inferior and infero-lateral\nsegments (basal infero-lateral aneurysm) and hypokinesis of the\nremaining segments (the lateral wall contracts best). LV\ndysynchrony is present). No masses or thrombi are seen in the\nleft ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. The right\nventricular cavity is moderately dilated with moderate global\nfree wall hypokinesis. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,\nascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets\n(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No\naortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are\nmildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**11-26**]+) mitral regurgitation\nis seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.\nModerate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild\npulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Significant pulmonic\nregurgitation is seen.

Portal vein is patent showing hepatopetal flow. A\ngallstone is seen in a collapsed gallbladder, grossly unchanged\nfrom prior CT examination. There is no intra-or extra-hepatic\nbiliary duct dilatation. The CBD measures 0.3 cm.  Trace amount\nof fluid is seen around the liver. The pancreas is unremarkable,\nnote is made that the pancreas tail is obscured\nby bowel gas. The spleen measures 12.7 cm and is unremarkable.\nNo fluid is seen in the right and left lower abdominal quadrant.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Trace amount of fluid around the liver.\n2. Cholelithiasis in a collapsed gallbladder.\n3. Normal echotexture of the liver with no intra- or\nextra-hepatic biliary\nduct dilatation.\n\n[**2-10**] CXR: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is\nunchanged evidence of a perihilar increase in density of the\nlung parenchyma, right more than left. The distribution of these\nchanges, notably combine to the cardiomegaly of the patient, are\nmore consistent with pulmonary edema than with pneumonia. There\nis no evidence of pleural effusions. Normal appearance of the\nhilar and mediastinal contours. Right central venous access line\nand left Port-A-Cath in situ.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nA/P: 80 yo M with h/o DM, CAD s/p CABG in [**2083**], [**2088**]), CHF with\nEF 20-25% s/p biv ICD, h/o prostate cancer and nephrolithiasis,\nwho p/w scrotal and LE edema suggestive of CHF exacerbation.\n.\n# CHF exacerbation: Likely precipitated primarily by BiV pacing\nbeing shut off, and also by dietary indiscretion. In [**10/2114**],\nhis LV lead was turned off as it was thought to be abutting a\nscar, and he was in VT storm at that time. He now presents with\nevidence of significant right-sided heart failure on admission\nwith scrotal and LE edema, but clear lungs and high O2 sats.\nGiven his borderline hypotension, lasix gtt was started and\nuptitrated to 20 mg/hr. However, the rate of diuresis continued\nto be suboptimal at -700cc/day. He was then transferred to CCU\nto initiate milrinone gtt. He tolerated this well, and with a\ncombination of lasix 30mg/hr and milrinone, was making\n~1000-1500cc/day, though given intakes was not really diuresing.\nRenal decided that he would benefit from dialysis. A temporary\nHD line was placed, and he received 2 ultrafiltration sessions,\nwith about 3L fluid removed per session. He then appeared to be\neuvolemic to slightly volume up. It was decided that his goal\nwas slightly volume up, given pre-load [**Last Name (LF) 105385**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]\nlasix/milrinone and ultrafiltration sessions were stopped on\n[**2-8**]. Given he is now on anti-arrythmics (mexilitine and\nquinidine), his LV lead was restarted. Previously, he has had\ngreat benefit from receiving BiV pacing, so did not want to give\nup on this therapy for him per attending. He continued to make\n1100-1700cc/day urine, and his creatinine continued to trend\ndown. He developed a cough and CXR showed slightly worsening\npulmonary edema, so his home dose of torsemide was restarted on\n[**2-10**], and he tolerated this well.\n.\n# oliguric acute on chronic kidney failure: He presented close\nto anuric, though to be pre-renal etiology from CHF causing\ndecreased RBF. Cr was markedly elevated from baseline of 1.7-2.0\nin [**10/2114**], to 4.9 on admission. Therapy for CHF (above)\nresulted in continual improvement in renal function. He received\n2 sessions of ultrafiltration, but did not get HD, given renal\ndid not think he needed it and they didn't want to cloud the\npicture in terms of his diuresis. By discharge, he was making\n1700cc urine per day, and creatinine was down to 3.0\n.\n# Urinary retention: foley was placed via cystoscopy on\nadmission, difficult in part [**12-27**] buried penis. Removed on [**2-11**]\nas thought to be unnecessary. On [**2-12**] he had urinary retention,\nwith 750cc residual after a small urination. His bladder was\ndistended and painful. Urology replaced the foley, and he should\nf/u with Urology (Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **]) in 2 weeks (appnt made for him)\n.\n# Hypokalemia: pt has had issues with hypokalemia, K+ 3.1\nlowest. Worse when he was receiving active diuresis. He has\nrequired near daily K+ repletion. At rehab, his K+ should be\nchecked regularly, so that he gets appropriate repletion. Also,\nhe has a metabolic alkalosis frmo diuresis. As this resolves, K+\nwill shift out of his cells and potentially create hyperkalemia,\nso that should be watched as well.\n.\n# scrotal swelling: Fluid retention [**12-27**] CHF exacerbation.\nUrology evaluated scrotum in the ED and felt there was no\ninfectious etiology. he received a scrotal U/S (per report\nsection), which was reassuring that infection was unlikely.\nEdema improved dramatically during admission, as was back to\nbaseline upon discharge\n.\n# CAD s/p CABG: EKG showed no new ischemic changes, and cardiac\nenzymes normal. He was ruled out for MI. Home aspirin 81 mg,\nisordil, metoprolol and atorvastatin were continued.\n.\n# RHYTHM/?afib: Pt is A/V paced, has BiV pacemaker for chronic\ndCHF, not on coumadin at home. Anticoagulated with ASA325 daily.\nMaintained on home mexilitine, quinidine, and metoprolol. His\nBiV was reactivated, per above.\n.\n# Cough: developed non-productive cough, no fever or\nleukocytosis. CXR from [**2-10**] (PA/LA) suggests pulmonary edema\nmore than pneumonia. He is not on an ACEi. Minimal relief with\nsaline nebs, ipratropium nebs, and tessalon pearls. Cough may be\n[**12-27**] pulm edema and perhaps will improve when that is cleared.\nStarted on guaifenesin w/ codeine as well, which is providing\nsymptomatic relief.\n.\n# DM: A1C 7.7%. Sugars well controlled with home Lantus and\nsliding scale.\n.\n# HLD: Good lipid profile, continued atorvastatin.\n.\n# intertrigo: Had a groin rash [**12-27**] scrotal edema. Successfully\ntreated with topical miconozole powder.\n.\n# anemia: Has baseline anemia with Hct in low-mid 30s, worsening\nduring this admission, labs suggestive anemia of chronic disease\nand likely contribution from CKD.\n.\n# Coagulopathy/thrombocytopenia: INR 1.2-1.5, albumin 3.2\nsuggests diminished synthetic function of liver. LFTs normal on\nadmission. RUQ U/S w/o liver abnormalities.  Hepatitis\nserologies also negative. Labs do not suggest consumptive\nprocess. Likely [**12-27**] congestive hepatopathy.\n.\n# IJ clot: Discovered upon placing HD line.

There is also left-sided\npleural effusion which is slightly increased from previous. No\novert pulmonary edema or pneumothoraces are seen. The cardiac\nsilhouette is prominent but unchanged.\n\nPortable CXR [**2121-3-2**]: IMPRESSION: Increased cardiogenic edema.\nCHEST, AP: Lung apices are obscured by overlying soft tissues.\nNo focal\nconsolidation is present. Venous congestion and bilateral\nlayering effusions are increased. Moderate cardiomegaly\npersists.\nIMPRESSION: Increased cardiogenic edema.\n\n\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n84 y/o F with hx of DM, CAD, CHF, COPD, afib, MM, HTN and CKD\nwho presents from NH with increased lethargy and hypoxia.\n\n# Hypoxia:  The patient has had multiple prior admissions for\nhypoxia in the setting of CHF exacerbation, although on this\nadmission did not appear significantly volume overloaded\nclinically or by initial chest film.  She reported cough x1\nweek, fever of 103.4 rectally in the ED, poor clearance of\nsecretions and aspiration risk (although no consolidation on\nfilm); she was therefore covered for hospital-acquired PNA with\nvanco and zosyn.  Blood cultures and urine cultures were\nnegative and her MRSA screen was negative. The patient was\nunable to provide a satisfactory sputum sample. Legionella UA\nwas negative. The patient was low risk by [**Doctor Last Name 3012**] Criteria for PE\nso no CTA. She underwent speech and swallow evaluation given\nconcern for possible aspiration, but was cleared for thin\nliquids and regular-consistency food (this study was done on\nhospital day 3 when she was more alert than on admission). She\nreceived IV furosemide PRN to maintain euvolemic volume status\nand then returned to her home dose of lasix. She was monitored\nin the MICU for 3 days, during which time OS was weaned to 3 L\nby NC (from initial facemask/NRB) and she eventually was weaned\nto room air. She remained afebrile after the initiation of Abx.\nA picc line was placed for continued antibiotic therapy as an\noutpatient. She ultimately expired on [**2121-3-9**].\n\n# AMS/lethargy: This was felt to be likely multifactorial, with\ncontributions from infection, hypoxia, and electrolyte\nimabalance in the setting of a severe underlying Alzheimer's\ndementia. MS followed a waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] course consistent with\ndelirium. Given h/o seizure disorder, it is possible that she\nhad ictal or postictal events, although there was no clear\nevidence of seizure.  She was at times borderline unresponsive\n(non-verbal, withdrawing to pain but not orienting to voice) and\nat other times awake, conversant, and able to communicate needs.\nAfter discussion with patient's daughter, it appeared that this\nwas not an acute event but she may have baseline waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 688**]\nmental status that has been going on for weeks to months in the\nsetting of frequent exacerbations of illness.  Treatment was\naimed at underlying infection, hypoxia and electrolyte\nimbalances with apparent improvement in MS.\n\n# Fever: To 103 rectally in ED per report. Patient was started\non broad spectrum antibiotics for presumed pulmonary source with\nresoultion of fevers. Lactate remained WNL, and WBC was not\nelevated.\n\n# Hypernatremia: Na was elevated on admission to 146. This\nultimately normalized with control of volume status to 140 by\nhospital day #3.\n\n# CHF: The patient has known CHF with LVEF of 25% and 3+ MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 28753**]o.  Given her recent admission [**Date range (1) 95167**] for presumed CHF\nexacerbation, it is likely that some degree of volume overload\ncontributed to her symptoms of hypoxia.\n.\n# COPD: The patient was continued on home medications, although\nalbuterol nebs were held in the setting of tachycardia.\n\n# Suprapubic swelling: The patient was noted to have right\nsuprapubic swelling involving the right labia majora which was\nsomewhat mobile but there was no defined mass. This may be due\nto a hernia or soft tissue mass such as a lipoma or fibroma.\nMalignancy was also considered. The patient did not experience\nany discomfort from the swelling and did not have any\nobstructive physiology. This was discussed with her daughter who\nwas the primary medical decision maker and a plan was made not\nto pursue this further diagnostically.\n.\n# Seizure Disorder: Phenytoin level was initially\nsubtherapeutic. The patient was started on phenytoin 100mg IV\nq8h with and was then converted to PO home dose when able to\ntolerate oral medications.\n\n# Atrial fibrillation: Initially patient had RVR to 150s, but\nrate was better controlled s/p IVF.  CE baseline.  INR was\nsubtherapeutic but Coumadin was held given concern that\nantibiotics may augment these levels. Metoprolol and digoxin\nwere continued; Coumadin was ultimately restarted and her INR\nwas 1.8 on last check.\n\n# Chronic renal failure: At baseline. Creatinine was trended\ndaily.\n\n# Coronary artery disease: EKG stable, elevated trop (at\nbaseline) likely related to CRF. She was continued on aspirin,\nstatin, BB.\n\n# Anemia: [**Month (only) 116**] be related to CRF, multiple myeloma. Hct stable at\nbaseline.\n\n# Multiple myeloma:  Trend creatinine and electrolytes. No\ntreatment at this time.\n\n# Diabetes: Patient was maintained on an insulin sliding scale.\n\nCode: She was a DNR/DNI during this hospitalization. Palliative\ncare was consulted and in discussion with her daughter [**Name (NI) 6359**],\nwho has been the primary medical decision maker, a plan was made\nfor the patient to return to [**Hospital3 **] under guardianship,\nwith a plan to become hospice care. However the patient\nultimately expired on [**2121-3-9**] in the hospital before this plan\ncould be executed. Her cause of death was pneumonia in the\nsetting of chronic congestive heart failure and alzheimer's\ndementia.\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\n1. Senna 8.6 mg [**Hospital1 **] prn constipation\n2.

Patient remained hemodynamically\nstable with stable Hct.\n\n# GI bleed:\nPatient presented with two episodes of hematochezia with\nsubsequent Hgb drop to ~ 9 likely due to polypectomy site\nbleeding complicated by primary hemostasis deficit given\nunderlying ITP. Patient was hemodynamically stable although\nslightly tachycardic at times. Patient transfused 4 units of\npRBC with Hgb elevation appropriately to ~ 12. She was\ntransferred to the floor from the MICU and monitored overnight.\nHer HCT remained stable at time of discharge, ambulating without\nsymptoms and no sign of ongoing bleeding.\n\n# ITP\nPatient likely experienced acute manifestation of underlying ITP\ngiven thrombocytopenia. Peripheral smear reviewed by hematology\nconsultants consistent with ITP with no signs of hemolysis seen.\nShe was transfused 2 bags of platelets.  Patient had been\nunresponsive to platelet transfusions in past. As result,\npatient was given treatment with IVIG x2 doses with goal of\nachieving more prolonged platelet response and avoiding side\neffects of prolonged steroid treatment with upcoming surgery for\n[**Month/Day (4) 499**] adenocarcinoma. She was started on dexamethasone 40 mg PO\ndaily for 4 days per hematology recs, and had 2 days remaining\nat time of discharge.  Plts were above 100,000 by the time of\ndischarge and pt was scheduled for hematology follow up.\n\n# Invasive adenocarcinoma: Patient noted to have adenocarcinoma\nfrom recent polyp biopsy. She was offerred anterior resection\nwhile in house in addition to splenectomy. Patient deferred and\nwill discuss with hematologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3459**].\n\n# Transition of care: She was discharged with follow-up in place\nwith GI/surgery and her primary hematologist to further discuss\npotential splenectomy with partial colectomy.\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nnone\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1. dexamethasone 4 mg Tablet Sig: Ten (10) Tablet PO DAILY\n(Daily) for 2 days.\nDisp:*20 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*\n\n\nDischarge Disposition:\nHome\n\nDischarge Diagnosis:\nPrimary:\nLower GI bleed\nITP\n\n\nDischarge Condition:\nMental Status: Clear and coherent.\nLevel of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.\nActivity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.\n\n\nDischarge Instructions:\nMs. [**Known lastname **], it was a pleasure taking part in your care.

The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter\ndifferentiation is preserved. No infarction is apparent. The\nsulci and ventricles are prominent consistent with generalized\natrophy. The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells\nare normally aerated. A NG tube is seen traversing the left\nnostril.\n.\nRUE Ultrasound: no DVT\n.\nEcho: Ejection Fraction: \u003e= 55% (nl \u003e=55%)\nINTERPRETATION:\nFindings:\nThis study was compared to the prior study of [**2145-10-29**].\nLEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.\nRIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.\nLEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size and\nsystolic\nfunction (LVEF\u003e55%). Normal regional LV systolic function. TDI\nE/e' \u003c 8,\nsuggesting normal PCWP (\u003c12mmHg).\nRIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.\nAORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.\nNo masses or  vegetations on aortic valve. Trace AR.\nMITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP. No\nmass or\nvegetation on mitral valve. Mild (1+) MR.\nTRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial\nTR. No mass or vegetation on tricuspid valve. Moderate PA\nsystolic hypertension.\nPULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.\nPERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.\nGENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.\n\nConclusions:\nThe left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left\nventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic\nfunction (LVEF\u003e55%). Regional  left ventricular wall motion is\nnormal. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a  normal left\nventricular filling pressure (PCWP\u003c12mmHg). Right ventricular\nchamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve\nleaflets (3)  are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not\npresent. No masses or  vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.\nTrace aortic regurgitation is seen.  The mitral valve leaflets\nare mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve  prolapse. No\nmass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral\n\nregurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery\nsystolic\nhypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial\neffusion.\nIMPRESSION: No echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis. Mild\nLVH with\npreserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.\nModerate\npulmonary hypertension. Compared with the prior study (images\nreviewed) of [**2145-10-29**], pulmonary hypertension is more severe.\nThe other findings are similar.\n.\nEEG:\nThis is an abnormal portable EEG due to the slow and\ndisorganized background rhythm as well as the bursts of\ngeneralized\nslowing. These abnormalities are suggestive of a moderate\nencephalopathy which may be seen with medications, toxic\nmetabolic\nabnormalities, or infections. There were no regions of focal\nslowing\nand no epileptiform discharges noted. Of note, there was an\nirregularly\nirregular rhythm with a tachycardic rate of 120 bpm.\n.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nThis 83 year old gentleman with a history of myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**],\natrial fibrillation on Coumadin, chronic kidney disease,\ndiabetes and hypothyroidism was admitted from an outside\nhospital for subacute mental status change.  He was initially\nadmitted to the MICU.  Over the first few days the patient was\nsomnolent and incoherent when aroused.  It was also noted the\npatient was producing a lot of secretions in his mouth and\nrequired frequent suctioning.   A head CT was notable only for\ndiffuse atrophy.  A chest x-ray was not revealing, but zosyn was\nbegan empirically given his secretions.  LP was not pursued as\nthe likelihood of CNS infection was believed low.  The patient\nwould occasionally go into atrial fibrillation with RVR but with\nno hemodynamic instability; initially on an esmolol drip which\nwas weaned off and replaced with diltiazem PO.  Digoxin, started\nat the OSH, was discontinued\n.\nIt was unclear what was the cause of this gentleman's mental\nstatus change; he had previously been interactive and social.\nOn review of his medications, it was noted that Mestinon, the\ncholinesterase inhibitor for his myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**], could rarely\ncause mental status change.  This was therefore discontinued.\nSome improvement in mental status was noted as the patient did\ngrow more alert.  Furthermore his secretions did decrease.  The\npatient was however, more agitated and remained incoherent.\nHaldol and Zyprexa was used with only limited effect.  The\npatient would often sundown quite severely. The patient did not\nexhibit signs of relapse of myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**].  On advice of\nneurology, Mestinon was restarted.  The patient became again\nless interactive and with copious secretions.  Of note, a blood\nculture returned with 3 out of 4 methicillin resistant Staph\nEpidermidis; this prompted 2 weeks of vancomycin therapy. His\noccult bacteremia was felt to be the leading candidate for his\nmental status changes.\n.\nThe patients mental status very slowly improved and it was the\nconclusion of the MICU team, the neurology and psychiatry\nconsult service that the patient was undergoing a prolonged\ndelirium.  Probably related to infection along with a\ntoxic-metabolic insult.  He continued to improve with treating\nthe bacteremia.  .\nAlso of note the patient was having more frequent runs of NSVT\nby week 2 of hospitalization. On advice of his cardiologist we\nrestarted and progressively up-titrated metoprolol for Afib,\nNSVT control, and re-added diltiazem po regimen to better\ncontrol rate.\n.\nWith improvement of his mental status, it was decided to\ntransfer the patient to a regular floor. Pt. mental status\ncontinued to wax and wane on floor. He underwent an EEG which\nwas normal.  He was found to have pan-sensitive pseudomonas UTI\nconfirmed by culture [**7-22**]. His foley was changed and\nciprofloxacin was started for a total of ten days.  Given poor\npo intake, altered mental status, and continued self d/c'ed NG\ntubes, a PEG tube was placed on [**7-22**]. With treatment of UTI pt.\nmental status improved and was felt to be suitable for rehab. LP\nwas not performed after discussion with son given a low\nlikelihood of CNS infection and the patient being uncooperative\nwith procedure.\n.\nHis blood sugar was well controlled with insulin, and his tube\nfeedings were advanced to goal through the PEG tube.  His renal\nfunction returned to baseline and remained stable.  His blood\npressure remained well controlled with metoprolol and diltiazem.\n\n.\nHe did experience some blood clots after changing his foley.  He\nhad already been switched from Coumadin to Lovenox for\nanti-coagulation for his history of atrial fibrillation.\nHowever, his hct was monitored and was noted to be lower (25)\nthan his baseline on the day of discharge.  His rectal exam\nrevealed brown guaiac negative stool.  He was started on\ncontinuous bladder irrigation to help clear the clots.  Iron\nstudies were sent which revealed a slightly low iron and low\nferritin.  A repeat hematocrit on the afternoon of discharge\nreturned stable at 27.\n.\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nmeds on transfer from OSH:\nDigoxin .25'\ncoumadin 3mg\nhaldol .5 IV q4 prn\nlorazepam .5mg IV prn\nLevaquin 500 IV'\nCardizem 120 mg'\nesmolol iv drip-recently weened off\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.

Diffuse sucal widening elsewhere.\n\nMRI/A:\nR IPH as above. 2 very small additional microbleeds on\nsuspectibility sequences. No vascular malformation. No\nunderlying mass.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nNEURO:\n[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 93995**] is a 71 yo right handed man wit an extensive past\nmedical history including Alzheimers dementia, CAD s/p stent,\ndiabetes s/p L BKA, vascular disease.\nHe presented from his nursing home with impairment of\nfollowing commands and left sided weakness. CT of the head at\n[**Hospital **] Hospital\ndemonstrated a cortical-based right frontal intraparenchymal\nhemorrhage. At [**Hospital1 18**], he was admitted for observation to the\nneuro ICU.\n\nThe most likely etiology for the IPH is amyloid angiopathy. The\npatient has a history of Alzheimers dementia, which is\nassociated with the same type of amyloid deposition. The\nlocation of the bleed is also extremely characteristic for\namyloid. There are 2 other very small microbleeds seen on MRI\nsuspectibility images. MRI/A did not show any other underlying\nmass for bleed, such as vascular malformation or tumor.\n\nNeurologic exam on discharge was notable for L lower facial\nweakness. He also had paratonia, limited upgaze, grasp, snout,\nglabellar, and jaw jerk reflexes. His speech is sparse with\noccasional stuttering and semantic errors. Naming was intact for\nhigh but not low frequency objects, repetition and comprehension\nwas intact. There was no neglect.\n\nIn regards to his underlying dementia, the patient did exhibit\nsigns of Parkinsonism including cogwheeling with distraction,\nand should be monitored carefully to see if he develops\nadditional Parkinsonian features. At this point, his dementia is\nstill relatively mild, and it is difficult to accurately\ndiagnose the type during one brief hospital visit. He will\nfollow up closely with his primary neurologist in [**Hospital1 **].\n\nBLOOD PRESSURE:\nBlood pressure was well controlled on home dose of atenlol. His\nblood pressure should be maintainned at SBP 140-160. His\nlisinopril was held, and should be restarted in the next week or\nso as his blood pressure tolerates.\n\nCAD:\nPlavix was held, and should be restarted in 2 weeks.\n\nFEVER:\nPatient had fever to 101.3 on evening of admission. CXR was\nclear, UA negative, urine and blood cx pending. He remained\nafebrile. WBC trended down. This may have been reactive to the\nintracranial bleed itself.\n\nFEN:\nHyponatremic on admission, most likely hypovolemic hyponatremia\nas it improved with 1L NS overnight.\nPatient passed speech and swallow evaluation for regular\nconsistency diet.\n\nENDO:\ncontinued home regimen of insulin\n\nFOLLOW UP:\nHe should have another CT with contrast in about 2.5-3 months\nwhich could be done at [**Hospital1 **] to make sure that there is no\npathological lesion or a mass that is\nunderlying the hemorrhage. F/u with Neurology in 3 months.\n\n\nMedications on Admission:\nAtenolol 50 mg PO DAILY\nLisinorpil 25mg daily\nVitamin B Complex 1 CAP PO DAILY\nAtorvastatin 10 mg PO DAILY\nAscorbic Acid 500 mg PO BID\nInsulin/lantus 20mg QHS,\nInsulin/Humalog 5/4/6 units Breakfast, lunch and dinner\nDonepezil 5 mg PO HS\nMirtazipine 7.5mg QHS\nPlavix 75mg daily\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1. atenolol 50 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).\n2.

IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.\n\nCT/CTP/CTA Head/Neck: Increased mean transit time with decreased\ncerebral blood volume and blood flow on the right occipital\nlobe, consistent with infarction in the right posterior cerebral\nartery vascular territory as described in detail above. The\npatient is status post aneurysm clipping via left frontotemporal\ncraniotomy. There is no evidence of acute intracranial\nhemorrhage or mass effect. Atherosclerotic calcifications are\nvisualized in the carotid cervical bifurcations, causing severe\nnarrowing at the origin of the right internal carotid artery.\n\nEcho: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity\nsize. No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by\n2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers. The\nestimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. The estimated\ncardiac index is normal (\u003e=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular\nchamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of\naorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The\naortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic\nstenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The\nmitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral\nregurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The estimated\npulmonary artery systolic pressure is high normal. There is an\nanterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.\nIMPRESSION:Trace aortic regurgitation with mild aortic valve\nsclerosis. No definite structural cardiac source of embolism\nidentified.\n\nCarotid U/S: Right ICA 70-79% stenosis, Left ICA 60-69%\nstenosis.\n\nMRI Head: Subacute infarction in the right PCA territory without\nevidence of hemorrhagic transformation with a possible\ninvolvement of the choroidal anterior artery territory.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nMe. [**Known lastname 47097**] was examined emergently in the ED of [**Hospital1 18**] and was\nfound to have a dense left homonymous hemianopia. Preliminary\nSTAT CT imaging showed the presence of hypoperfusion in a right\nPCA distribution. His case was discussed with the attending\nStroke Neurologist and informed consent was obtained for TPA\nadministration, for which there were no apparent\ncontraindications. TPA was administered without any acute\ncomplications, and he was admitted to the ICU for post-TPA\nmonitoring with q1hr neuro checks, etc. As he remained\nhemodynamically stable and with stable neurologic examinations,\nhe was transferred out of the ICU. His left visual field cut\nbecame less dense over time, but at the time of discharge, he\nstill had quite a significant visual field cut.\n\nSeveral studies were done to work up his stroke. We obtained the\nmake/model number of his aneurysm clips from [**Hospital1 2025**] (he has a\nhistory of a left ICA and left ACOMM aneurysm clipped by [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **]\n[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1128**] from [**Hospital1 2025**]), and with this information, we were able to\nobtain an MRI of his head, which identified a single area of\nrestricted diffusion in the right PCA distribution. Several days\nof telemetry monitoring did not identify any evidence of atrial\nfibrillation. His CTA done on admission did identify scattered\natherosclerotic lesions in his intra and extracranial blood\nvessels, including the internal carotid arteries. A carotid US\ndid show right ICA stenosis of 70-79% and left ICA stenosis of\n60-69%. However, these bilateral stenoses were not the cause of\nhis posterior circulation infarct. These bilateral ICA stenoses\nwill need to be monitored for plaque progression in the future.\n\nHis LDL returned elevated and he was started on statin therapy,\nand was of course also placed on a daily aspirin as secondary\nprophylaxis against future strokes. He was counseled extensively\non the importance of quitting smoking cigarettes. An\nechocardiogram was performed which did not reveal any obvious\nembolic source and no obvious valvular pathology.\n\nGiven his left visual field cut, he was strictly advised NOT to\ndrive prior to having a formal OPHTHALMOLOGICAL examination with\nvisual field testing. In addition, he was given information\nabout the [**Hospital1 18**] Drivewise program, which is a comprehensive\nevaluation of one's driving abilities following a variety\ndifferent physical and neurologic disabilities. At the time of\ndischarge, he was able to ambulate independently, had no focal\nneurologic signs (other than a resolving left visual field\ndeficit) and was cognitively intact.\n\nTransitional Issues:\n- HOLTER MONITOR\n- Neurology Follow Up\n- Eye examination with formal visual field testing\n\nMedications on Admission:\nCozaar 50mg [**Hospital1 **]\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1. docusate sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO BID (2\ntimes a day).\nDisp:*60 Capsule(s)* Refills:*0*\n2. oxycodone 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q4H (every 4\nhours) as needed for headache.\nDisp:*20 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*\n3. atorvastatin 10 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY\n(Daily).\nDisp:*60 Tablet(s)* Refills:*1*\n4. aspirin 81 mg Tablet, Chewable Sig: One (1) Tablet, Chewable\nPO DAILY (Daily).\nDisp:*60 Tablet, Chewable(s)* Refills:*1*\n5.

You were admitted to the neuro-intensive care\nunit and the neurology wards of the [**Hospital1 827**] for symptoms of headache, left sided numbness and\nleft sided visual loss that you experienced while playing\nsolitaire. Through a series of interviews, physical\nexaminations, laboratory tests and neuroimaging studies, we\ndetermined that you sustained a stroke in the right OCCIPITAL\nregion of your brain. The cause of this stroke was likely\nrelated to atherosclerosis or plaques in the arteries of your\nbrain that be caused by risk factors such as high blood\npressure, high cholesterol and smoking. As we were able to\nidentify your stroke relatively quickly, you received TPA or\ntissue plasminogen activator therapy (a \"Clotbusting\"\nmedication) that at times can improve the symptoms of stroke.\n- We have made some changes to your medications as listed below.\nPlease take your medications as prescribed, and do not hesitate\nto contact us should you have any questions or concerns. We have\nstarted on you a daily ASPIRIN and a CHOLESTEROL lowering\nmedication called ATORVASTATIN. For your headache, we have\nprescribed you OXYCODONE. Oxycodone can sometimes cause\nconstipation, for which we have prescribed you a stool softener\ncalled DOCUSATE. Continue to take COZAAR as you were previously\ndoing.\n- We expect that your headache will get better over time. To\nreduce the impact of these headaches, we ask that you stay well\nhydrated, eat regular meals, have regular sleep cycles and avoid\npain medications on a daily basis.\n- Some strokes, such as the one you sustained, can affect your\nability to drive. We have referred you to a program at [**Hospital1 18**]\ncalled DRIVEWISE, which is a comprehensive assessment conducted\nby skilled therapists who are able to certify your ability to\ndrive safely. Please be sure to follow up with them. Their phone\nnumber is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 110357**], and they will contact you to set up an\nappointment.\n- Please come to the nearest ED should you have any of the below\nlisted unexplained symptoms.\n- We have organized a follow up appointment for you to see Dr.\n[**First Name (STitle) 5846**], who is your primary care physician. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] ask that you take\nthese records with you as well as ALL your current medications\nat that time.

He was admitted from\nrehab after combative behavior and intermittent confusion.  This\nwas thought to be related to either not wearing CPAP at night or\nfrom infection.  He has many possible sources of infection. He\nis being treated for T9 epidural abscess (below) with IV\nceftriaxone through [**7-7**].  He has a stage 3+ sacral\ndecubitus ulcer that is not healing well and that was debrided\nduring this hospitalization (below). He had a urine culture\npositive for staph species.  He was also having diarrhea but c.\ndiff was sent and was negative.  Blood cultures were also\nnegative. Psych was consulted for delerium and recommended\nfrequent reorientation, discontinuation of seroquel, and\nrecommended starting haldol 1 mg IV/IM prn for agitation or\ncombativeness. He required several doses early in his\nhospitalization, but did not requre any doses for several days\nprior to discharge to rehab.\n\n# Unstageable decubitus ulcer: Patient was seen by surgery who\ntook the patient to the OR on [**6-14**] for debridement of the sacral\nulcer and followed throughout the remainder of hospitalization\nfor regular wound checks and dressing changes.  Wound care\nnurses were also involved in caring for ulcer with collagenase\nointment and regular turning given paralysis (below).  Surgery\nrecommended temporary diverting colostomy given chronic diarrhea\nthat was possibly contaminating wound.  Patient decided against\nthis option, but will reconsider if wound fails to heal.\n\n# Pleural effusions in setting likely volume overload in the\nsetting of Chronic systolic heart failure: From prior\nhospitalization. His EF was 35% per report from [**2155-6-1**].  He\nwas initially on furosemide 80 mg QAM and furosemide 40 mg QPM\nand this was titrated down as effusions improved and he began to\ndevelop acute kidney injury (below). He was discharged on\nfurosemide 40 mg QAM and this should be further titrated down if\nrenal function worsens.\n\n# Epidural abscess and T9 osteomyelitis s/p debridement and\nfusion: From prior hospitalization.  He was continued on\nceftriaxone 2 gm IV Q24H which he will continue through\n[**2155-7-10**].  He was also continued on calcitriol, calcium\ncarbonate, and vitamin D.  He should have follow up scheduled\nwith Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1352**] of orthopedics.\n\n# History of coronary artery disease s/p CABG and [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7792**] on\nprevious admission. Patient was continued on aspirin,\natorvastatin, and clopidogrel.  He did experience several\nepisodes of substernal chest pain during admission, though ECGs\nwere stable without new ischemic changes, troponins were\ntrending down (elevated to 0.26 from prior admission). Pain was\nreproducible and was likely musculoskeletal in origin.  ACEi was\nheld in the setting [**Last Name (un) **] restarting this medication should be\nconsidered as renal function improves.\n\n# Hypotension: Resolved from prior admission. SBPs were 110-150s\non the floor.  We continued to hold his Fludrocortisone as he\nwas started on lasix (above). His midodrine was also held\ninitally but restarted prior to discharge.  This should be\naddressed as outpatient. Consider transitioning back to home\nregimen as blood pressure tolerates.\n\n# [**Last Name (un) **]: Creatinine elevated to peak of 2.4 and was likely\nprerenal from agressive diuresis for pleural effusions (above).\nFurosemide was titrated down and creatinine returned to baseline\nof 1.9-2.2 from prior hospitalization.\n\n# OSA: Patient requires CPAP at night and continued to use\nthroughout hospitalization with O2 saturations in the mid-high\n90s.\n\n# Complete AV Block / Tachycardia-Bradycardia syndrome: Per\ncardiology and EP, a pacemaker is likely to be required after\nhis acute osteomyelitis has resolved and antibiotics course\ncompleted. He had one episode of asymptomatic bradycardia to 30\nwhich resolved within 60 seconds. ECG was normal and no\nintervention was done. He should follow-up with his cardiologist\nDr. [**Last Name (STitle) 13310**] on [**7-7**] at which time a pacemaker should be\nconsidered.\n\n# Diarrhea: Reported to have loose bowel movements w/ c diff\nodor.

Overall the\npatient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was\ntransferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and\ninvasive monitoring.\nPOD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and\nbreathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact\nand hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and\nvasopressor support.  He did have some ventricular ectopy out of\nthe OR and was started on Amiodarone.  He subsequently developed\na brief episode of rate controlled Atrial Fibrillation.  Beta\nblocker was initiated and the patient was gently diuresed toward\nthe preoperative weight. AFib persisted and he was\nanti-coagulated with Coumadin.  The patient was transferred to\nthe telemetry floor for further recovery.  Chest tubes and\npacing wires were discontinued without complication.  The\npatient was evaluated by the physical therapy service for\nassistance with strength and mobility.  By the time of discharge\non POD 4 the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was\nhealing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.

CAD: As above pt is s/p STEMI, s/p cardiac cath with stenting\nof his LAD.  Following his cardiac catheterization, the pt??????s\ncardiac enzymes trended down. He was briefly placed on a nitro\ndrip for ? of cardiac chest pain vs. indigestion, but was\nquickly weaned off the drip and remained chest pain free for the\nremainder of his hospitalization. He was placed on aspirin,\nplavix, lopressor, and a statin  post-stenting and continued on\nthese medications throughout his hospitalization. The pt was\nalso placede on coumadin for anti-coagulation.\n.\n2. Pump: Post MI the pt??????s echo showed overall left ventricular\nsystolic function depression with akinesis of the antero-septum,\nanterior wall and apex. The remaining segements of his LV\nappeared hypokinetic (basal lateral wall moves best). No masses\nor thrombi were seen in the left ventricle. The pt was placed on\nlisinopril for afterload reduction as well as being continued on\nhis HD.\n.\n3. Rhythm: Pt was monitored on telemetry throughout his\nhospitalization. Post MI the pt remained largely in NSR with\noccasional PVCs. However, post-MI he was  noted to have LAFB and\nRBBB.  It was unclear whether this was his baseline or the\nresult of his MI. The pt did have an episode of Afib with RVR.\nThe pt was loaded with amiodarone. Initially he was planned to\nreceive amio 800 mg qd X1 week with a taper in the usual fashion\n(400 qd X 1 wk, then 200 qd X1 week). However, given that this\nwas an isolated episode and that the pt  is no longer\nexperiencing Afib with RVR the pt??????s amiodarone will be decreased\nto 200 mg, to be worked up further by his out-pt cardiologist.\n\n4. h/o HTN: As above, the pt??????s blood pressure was\nwell-controlled on lopressor 100 mg [**Hospital1 **].\n.\n5. COPD:  The pt was initially wheezing on exam. The pt was\nstarted on his out-pt alb/atrovent nebs. Serially CXRs were\nfollowed and demonstrated stable b/l pleural effusions.\nFollowing the administration of his nebs he has been\nasymptomatic.\n.\n6. ESRD on HD: The pt received dialysis on Tu/Th/Sat. His meds\nwere renally dosed.\n\n7. Physical limitations: The pt has had continued difficulty\nwith transfers out of bed unless assisted. PT has recommended\n[**Hospital 31940**] rehab. The pt has also had continued musculoskeletal\n??????related right shoulder pain. The pt should receive continued PT\nfor this issue as well.\n.\n8.

Her allo bone marrow\ntransplant was [**2188-8-4**].  After her allo bone marrow\ntransplant, she developed tachypnea, tachycardia, fever and\nacute renal failure as well as respiratory failure.  She was\ntransferred to the Intensive Care Unit.  For further detail,\nplease see the Intensive Care Unit discharge summary.\n\nThe patient was then transferred to the floor [**2188-9-8**].  This\nwill be discharge summary while she is on the floor from\n[**2188-9-8**], through [**2188-10-4**].\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE:\n1.  Acute renal failure - The patient's acute renal failure\nwas resolved prior to returning to the floor.  Her creatinine\nwas very stable.  She did not have any more need of dialysis,\nmaking very good urine output.  No acute issue.\n\n2.  Graft versus host disease - The patient has skin biopsy\ndone on [**2188-9-20**], which was consistent with graft versus host\ndisease.  The patient continued to be on high dose\nSolu-Medrol for control.  Skin rash was stable and was\nactually improving throughout her hospital stay during this\nperiod.  The patient has episodes of diarrhea which most\nlikely are not due to graft versus host disease but due to\nintolerance to diary product.  After the patient stopped\ntaking diary products, her diarrhea improved and did not\nrecur.\n\n3.  Respiratory failure - The patient was intubated while in\nIntensive Care Unit and was extubated also in Intensive Care\nUnit.  The patient did very well while on the floor until\n[**2188-10-3**].  Her oxygen saturation dropped from 97 to 99% to\nabout 93 to 94% and CT scan was done and actually showed the\npatient to have superior segment of her right lower lobe\nshowing opacity, may be question of developing pneumonia.\nThe patient also had some coughing develop about the same\ntime.  The coughing was somewhat nonproductive.  The patient\nwas started on Cefepime.\n\n4.  Urinary tract infection - The patient had Foley in after\nshe was discharged from the Intensive Care Unit for more than\na month and on [**2188-10-3**], her urine culture actually grew out\ngram negative rod and she had a positive urinalysis showing\npositive leukocytes as well as white blood cells.  Again,\nCefepime was started and Foley was removed.\n\n5.  Intensive Care Unit myopathy - The patient developed both\nlower and upper extremity weakness while in Intensive Care\nUnit.  The patient has been working with both physical\ntherapy and occupational therapy regularly.  Improvement is\nvery slow.  The patient's muscle strength is about 2+/5 in\nboth upper and lower extremities throughout this period.\n\n6.  TTP - The patient developed TTP like picture while in\nIntensive Care Unit which required daily plasmapheresis.  The\npatient continued with plasmapheresis until her hematocrit\nand her LDH and platelet counts reached more stable status\nand plasmapheresis was stopped a week ago although her\nhematocrit continued to steadily slowly decrease while LDH\nslowly increased.  The decision was made to restart\nplasmapheresis not as frequent, most likely once per week.\nThe patient will receive her plasmapheresis on Monday,\n[**2188-10-6**], again.\n\n7.  Nutrition - The patient was on TPN since Intensive Care\nUnit and while on the floor and her TPN has been discontinued\nsince [**2188-9-18**].  The patient has been taking really good p.o.\nintake.  There is no active issue.\n\n8.  Hyperglycemia - The patient continued to require some\nregular insulin sliding scale doses on a daily basis.\n\n9.  Depression/anxiety - The patient has been followed by\npsychiatrist who recommended starting Risperdal both morning\nand evening and for anxiety control.  The patient's\nanxiousness has been better, however, still feels very\ndepressed.  Celexa was recommended but not started due to its\npotential of interfering with platelet function and the\npatient has low platelet level.\n\n10. Lymphedema - Especially on the left arm, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] had\nseen the patient [**2188-9-18**], and offered some recommendation\nsuch as splint and [**Male First Name (un) **] stocking.  The patient was not ready\nfor using this and would like to get down her overall fluid\nretention of her whole body.  The patient while in the\nIntensive Care Unit developed edema both upper and lower\nextremities which could be from her renal failure and could\nbe from her high dose steroid use.  The patient continued to\nsuccessfully diurese in the past two weeks.  She has been\nlosing an average of about one liter per day and her weight\nhas steadily declined throughout the last two weeks.  She did\nvery well.\n\nThis dictation covers up to [**2188-10-4**], of her hospital course.\n\n\n\n\n                            [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 1730**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 6175**], M.D.  [**MD Number(2) 10997**]\n\nDictated By:[**Name8 (MD) 18513**]\nMEDQUIST36\n\nD:  [**2188-10-4**]  13:31\nT:  [**2188-10-4**]  14:36\nJOB#:  [**Job Number 101809**]\n"}
{"TEXT":"Admission Date:  [**2128-10-21**]       Discharge Date:  [**2128-10-28**]\n\n\nService:  Medicine\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 88 year old male was\nadmitted from rehabilitation with a complaint of one day of\nmelena.  The patient was recently admitted from [**9-11**] to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3867**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] status post\na fall, with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive\nheart failure, mitral regurgitation, paroxysmal atrial\nfibrillation and was thereafter discharged to [**Hospital **]\nRehabilitation.\n\nThe patient was doing well until he developed a large amount\nof melanic stool on [**2128-10-21**] and also complained of\nrectal pain.  He had no nausea or vomiting.  His hematocrit\non the morning of admission was 32, blood pressure 90/50 with\na heart rate of 73.  A repeat hematocrit at 8:00 p.m. showed\na drop to 27 and he was sent to the Emergency Room.\n\nIn the Emergency Room, the patient denied shortness of\nbreath, chest pain or abdominal pain.  He vomited blood,\nhowever, times two cups and continued to have tarry stools\nand rectal pain.  His hematocrit fell to 24.\nGastroenterology was consulted and they made a plan to\nperform an electrocardiogram if the patient remained stable.\nHe was started on intravenous fluids and Protonix.  The\npatient has a history of bleeding ulcer ten years ago.  He\ndenies a history of hemorrhoids or diverticula.  He denies an\nalcoholic history or anticoagulation.  He does note a 30\npound weight loss in approximately one year, which is\nunintentional.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Coronary artery disease, status\npost myocardial infarction in [**2107**], no cardiac\ncatheterization reports available.  2.  History of paroxysmal\natrial fibrillation and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia,\nnot on anticoagulation at this time.  3.  History of\ncongestive heart failure.  4.  Echocardiogram dated [**2128-10-1**] showed severe mitral regurgitation with partial\nflail of one leaflet, marked left atrial enlargement, left\nventricular hypertrophy, left ventricular ejection fraction\napproximately 55%, basal hypokinesis and undetermined amount\nof aortic stenosis, however, moderate to severe mitral\nregurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation, and moderate\npulmonary hypertension.  5.  Status post DDD pacemaker in\n[**2118**] for tachy-brady syndrome; patient also has an old\npacemaker which is not functioning.  6.  History of peptic\nulcer disease ten years ago with bleeding; status post normal\ncolonoscopy ten years ago.  7.  Hypertension.  8.\nDepression.  9.  Recent admission for a fall and rule out\nmyocardial infarction, discharged to [**Hospital6 3953**].  10.  Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline\ncreatinine of 1.8.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives alone.  He is currently at\n[**Hospital **] Rehabilitation.  His proxy is [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 54731**] at\n[**Telephone/Fax (1) 103022**]; this is a nephew.  The patient has been widowed\nfor two years.  He denies alcohol use and has a remote 30\nyear smoking history.  The patient is \"Do Not\nResuscitate\"/\"Do Not Intubate\".  The patient has no children.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.\n\nALLERGIES:  Penicillin, aspirin, cephalosporins,\nnon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (unknown reactions).\n\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Isordil 10 mg p.o.t.i.d., Imodium\n2 mg p.o.q.d., multivitamins one p.o.q.d., calcitonin, Ultram\n50 mg p.o.t.i.d., Prevacid 30 mg p.o.b.i.d., Roxicodone 5 mg\np.o.q.6h.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, the patient\nhad a temperature of 96.9, heart rate 94 to 110, blood\npressure 110/72, 80s/50s, respiratory rate 16.  General:\nPale, ill appearing elderly male in distress, cachectic,\ncomplaining of rectal pain and feeling cold.  Head, eyes,\nears, nose and throat:  Pale, extraocular movements intact,\npupils equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation,\nanicteric sclerae.  Neck:  Supple without jugular venous\ndistention or lymphadenopathy.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation\nbilaterally anteriorly and posteriorly, without crackles.\nCardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm, systolic ejection\nmurmur and holosystolic III/VI apical murmur consistent with\naortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation.  Abdomen:  Soft,\nnontender, nondistended, decreased bowel sounds, no\nhepatosplenomegaly.  Rectal:  Frank melena and tenderness.\nExtremities:  No edema, warm and dry, 2+ dorsalis pedis\npulses bilaterally.\n\nLABORATORY DATA:  Electrocardiogram showed atrial\nfibrillation at a rate of 109 beats per minute with normal\naxis, T wave inversion and ST depression in V2 through V6\nwhich was new since [**2128-9-11**].  On [**2128-9-14**],\nhematocrit was 34; on [**2128-10-21**], hematocrit dropped\nfrom 32 to 27.  In the Emergency Room, white blood cell count\nwas 6, hemoglobin 7.7, hematocrit 24, platelet count 192,000,\nsodium 137, potassium 5, chloride 100, bicarbonate 27, BUN\n69, creatinine 1.8, glucose 124, prothrombin time 13.2, INR\n1.2, partial thromboplastin time 30 and digoxin level 0.9.\nHelicobacter pylori antibodies were sent and were negative.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Gastrointestinal:  The patient was\ntransfused five units.  His nadir hematocrit was 21.7 after\nthe first.  The patient underwent an\nesophagogastroduodenoscopy on [**2128-10-22**] after\nepisodes of hypotension, T wave inversions and ST depression\non his electrocardiogram, felt to be related to anemia and\ndecreased intravascular volume.  Endoscopy showed a normal\nesophagus, a gastric post ulcerative deformity in the\npylorus, coffee-ground fluid in the stomach body, clotted\nblood in the duodenal bulb, multiple cratered ulcers which\nranged in size from 10 mm to more than 30 mm in the duodenal\nbulb with stigmata of recent bleeding.  Epinephrine and BICAP\nelectrocautery were applied successfully for hemostasis.\n\nThe patient was monitored in the Medical Intensive Care Unit\nuntil he had a stable hematocrit and then he was transferred\nto the floor on [**2128-10-23**].  He was stable on the\nfloor with a normal hematocrit and declining creatinine to\n1.2 on [**2128-10-23**].  On [**2128-10-24**], however,\nthe patient had a large melanic stool.  Over the course of\nthat night, he had several other large melanic stools and he\nwas transferred back to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  He\nhad a repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy on [**2128-10-25**], which showed normal esophagus, normal stomach, two\nduodenal ulcers in the bulb, the largest 3 cm in size,\nstigmata of bleeding from flat spots in the ulcer base and\nsome oozing from the edges.  BICAP was again applied for\nsuccessful hemostasis.\n\nAfter this procedure, the patient was restarted on\nintravenous Protonix.  He was also treated with Carafate as\nadditional gastric protection.  His diet was slowly advanced\nfrom nothing by mouth to clear liquids, to a full diet, which\nthe patient tolerated well.  His serial hematocrits on the\nfloor were stable.  Gastroenterology recommended a course of\nProtonix to include 40 mg twice a day times two weeks then 40\nmg daily times an additional 46 days.  Therefore, the patient\nhad no gastrointestinal issues.\n\n2.  Cardiovascular:  The patient's coronary artery disease\nwas difficult to treat effectively given his potential\nhemodynamic instability with gastrointestinal bleeding.  The\npatient was managed with small doses of metoprolol in the\nMedical Intensive Care Unit, under close hemodynamic\nmonitoring to control his ventricular rate.  This was\nconverted to oral metoprolol on the floor, especially when he\nhad a stable hematocrit.  The patient was not treated with\nany aspirin and he could not be treated with Coumadin to\ncover his atrial fibrillation.  Therefore, he remains at high\nrisk for stroke.  The patient ruled out for a myocardial\ninfarction early in his stay.\n\n3.  Renal:  The patient's creatinine declined to better than\nhis supposed baseline of 1.8, to a level as low as 0.9.  He\ndid have a decreased urine output at times, however, his\ncreatinine remained low at all times and there was a question\nof whether his urine was being adequately collected.\n\n4.  Infectious disease:  The patient developed a leukocytosis\nwith a white blood cell count of 11.  Urinalysis was\nnegative.  A chest x-ray showed no infiltrate.  Urine\ncultures are pending at the time of discharge, however, the\npatient denies urinary tract symptoms.  This may be due to\nstress in the hospital setting.  He did not receive\nantibiotics during his stay.\n\n5.  Musculoskeletal:  The patient, after his\nesophagogastroduodenoscopies, complained of severe shoulder,\nknee and forearm pain, with normal range of motion and\nstrength limited by pain.  Reflexes could not be tested due\nto patient noncompliance.  Shoulder films were obtained, with\nquestion of osteoarthritis in these joints, also with a\nquestion of metastases given the patient's general cachexia,\nthinking that he may have an unknown primary tumor.  These\nfilms were negative.  At this point, the most likely\ndiagnosis is pain related to developing the very beginnings\nof contractures with disuse, being inactive in his hospital\nbed.  Physical therapy was consulted and continues to follow\nthe patient and encourage range of motion activities and to\nassist with his rehabilitation.\n\n6.  Hematology/oncology:  The patient was noticed to be\nsignificantly cachectic.  An underlying malignancy was\nsuspected, however, none was seen on\nesophagogastroduodenoscopy.  The patient would definitely\nbenefit, diagnostically at least, from an outpatient\ncolonoscopy.  However, he is refusing any invasive procedures\nat this time.  Another thought is that, with his smoking\nhistory, he might benefit from a chest CT to evaluate for a\npulmonary malignancy.  At this point, the patient's\ndepression and disinterest in pursuing this workup is\nlimiting.  The patient was treated with a total of five units\nof packed red blood cells, which he tolerated well and ha\nappropriate bumps in his hematocrit once BICAP of two ulcers\nwas performed.\n\n7.  Psychiatry:  The patient developed worsening of his\ndepression and, at times, frank suicidal ideation, saying\nthat he did not wish to undergo any further procedures, that\nhe wanted to give up, that his life was not worth living, and\nthat he would be better off dead.  The patient was therefore\nfollowed by psychiatry.  They recommended increasing his\nRemeron to 22.5 mg.  B12 and folate were checked, and these\nwere normal.  RPR was pending.  Psychiatry recommended an\nadditional 7.5 mg of Remeron as needed for agitation or\ninsomnia and also recommended the use of 0.5 mg incremental\nHaldol for agitation, should that develop.  They followed him\nclosely and felt that he did not need inpatient psychiatric\nevaluation and that he would be safe for discharge to\n[**Hospital **] Rehabilitation without the need for a one-to-one\nsitter.  He will be followed as an outpatient in that\nsetting.\n\n8.  Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  The patient's\nelectrolytes, including potassium and phosphorous, were\nrepeated as needed.  His diet was advanced to a heart\nhealthy, low sodium diet as tolerated.  At the time of\ndischarge, he is taking full oral intake.  The patient was\nnoticed to have some decreased urine output but this is felt\nto be related to poor recording of ins and outs, as his\ncreatinine is below his reported baseline.\n\nCONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Stable.\n\nDISCHARGE STATUS:  \"Do Not Resuscitate\"/\"Do Not Intubate\".\n\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:\nDuodenal peptic ulcer disease with upper gastrointestinal\nbleed.\nSee also past medical history.\n\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:\nRemeron 22.5 mg p.o.q.h.s.\nHaldol p.o./i.v. 0.5 mg to 1 mg increments q.1h. agitation.\nProtonix 40 mg p.o.b.i.d.\nMetoprolol 25 mg p.o.b.i.d.\nTylenol 1 gm p.o.q.6h.p.r.n. pain.\nMorphine 0.5 to 1 mg i.v.q.2h.p.r.n. pain.\nDigoxin 0.625 mg p.o.q.d.\nCarafate 1 gm p.o.q.i.d.\nMultivitamins one p.o.q.d.\nImodium 2 mg p.o.q.d.p.r.n.\nThe patient has not been receiving his Isordil 10 mg\np.o.t.i.d.; this may be restarted if needed on an outpatient\nbasis.\nCalcitonin; patient may resume outpatient dosing as needed.\n\n\n\n\n                            [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 312**] [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 313**], M.D.  [**MD Number(1) 314**]\n\nDictated By:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]\nMEDQUIST36\n\nD:  [**2128-10-28**]  11:22\nT:  [**2128-10-28**]  11:31\nJOB#:  [**Job Number 45658**]\n"}

She was\nrecently worked up for headache, neck pain, and vision loss.\nThe patient then had a fall down the stairs with no loss of\nconsciousness of head injury.\n\nThe patient was brought into to the Emergency Department by\nambulance.  She denied chest pain, shortness of breath, or a\nfamily history of stroke or aneurysm.\n\nCONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  On physical examination,\nthe patient's temperature was 97.8 degrees Fahrenheit, her\nheart rate was 67, her blood pressure was 159/66, and her\noxygen saturation was 100% on a nonrebreather mask.  The\npatient was alert and confused.  Not following commands.  She\nwas moving all four extremities spontaneously to pain.  She\nopened her eyes.  Her face was symmetric.\n\nThe patient did deteriorate shortly after admission.  A head\ncomputed tomography showed a large subarachnoid hemorrhage\n(left greater than right).  She had a vent drain placed on\nadmission to the Intensive Care Unit.  She was emergently\nintubated.  Her blood pressure was kept below 130.  She had a\ncomputed tomography angiogram which showed a left middle\ncerebral artery aneurysm which was unable to be coiled.\n\nThe patient was taken to the operating room for aneurysm\nclipping on [**2195-11-23**].  Preoperatively her exam was\nsignificant for right dense hemiparesis and she was able to\nfollow commands. She tolerated the procedure well.\nPostoperatively, the patient was moving her left side\nspontaneously, leg more than the arm.  The right side was\nhemiplegic.  The pupils were equal, round, and reactive to\nlight.  She moved the left side to command on the 11th and\nwithdrew her lower extremities briskly (right upper).  She\nhad slight internal rotation to painful stimulation.  She was\ncontinued on a vent drain and to be intubated.\n\nOn the 12th, the patient went to angiogram to assess\nplacement of the clip which was in good placement, and there\nwas no evidence of vasospasm.  The patient continued to be\nmaintained with every 1-hour neurologic checks in the\nIntensive Care Unit with a vent drain in place.\n\nOn the 13th, she was squeezing the left hand to command and\nwiggling her toes to command.  No movement on the right side.\nSlight internal rotation of the right upper extremity to\npain.\n\nA computed tomography scan on [**2195-11-27**] showed no\nchange.  The patient continued to be monitored with every\n1-hour neurologic checks in the Intensive Care Unit.\n\nOn the [**2195-11-30**] HHH therapy was initiated to prevent\nvasospasm.  The patient opened her eyes and squeezed her hand\non the left.  The right upper extremity was plegic.  She\nwithdrew her lower extremity.  Vent drain remained at 10 cm\nabove the tragus.  She spiked a temperature to 102.4 on the\n18th and was treated with Levaquin prophylactically and\ncontinued to be on Kefzol for vent drain prophylaxis.\n\nShe was extubated on [**2195-12-2**].  The patient failed\nextubation and was re-intubated on the 20th.  She was opening\nher eyes and squeezing the left hand to voice.  She was\nfollowing commands and was wiggling toes on the left side\nwith a right facial grimace and minimal withdrawal on the\nright upper extremity.\n\nA head computed tomography showed stable left frontotemporal\nand parietal hematoma, decreased midline shift, decreased\n[**Doctor Last Name 352**]/white differentiation, and question of a left\nfrontotemporal infarction.\n\nOn the 25th, the patient turned her head to stimulation and\nattempted to localize in the left upper.  Minimal internal\nrotation of the right arm.  Slight withdrawal in the right\nlower extremity.  Pupils were 3 mm and trace reactive.  The\npatient continued to be maintained with HHH therapy with\nboluses intermittently intravenous fluids to keep her\npressure at 160 to 180.\n\nOn [**12-8**], the patient's neurologic status deteriorated.\nShe became more lethargic and was not moving her left upper\nextremity or lower extremity.  She was taken for a STAT head\ncomputed tomography and emergent angiogram.\n\nA head computed tomography on [**12-9**] showed severe mass\neffect with left hemispheric, left-to-right shift and subfalcine\nherniation. Computed tomography and angiogram showed a large\namount of swelling.  The patient was receiving mannitol and\nDecadron.\n\nOn [**2195-12-9**] the patient was taken to the operating\nroom for a craniectomy on the left side due to edema.  The\npatient tolerated the procedure well.  Postoperatively, the\npatient was intubated and sedated.  She was opening her eyes\nto noxious stimulation, localizing in the left upper,\nwithdrawing bilateral lower extremity.  Pupils were 4 mm down\nto 3 mm.  The vent drain continued to be in place at a level\nof 10 cm above the tragus.\n\nThe patient had [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain in place which was\ndiscontinued on [**2195-12-12**].  She was localizing in the\nleft upper extremity and opening her eyes to stimulation.\nPupils were equal and brisk.  She was moving her toes (left\ngreater than right).\n\nOn [**12-15**], the patient was opening her eyes\nspontaneously.  She was turning her head toward the examiner.\nThe right upper extremity continued to have slight internal\nrotation, briskly localizing on the left.  She was\nwithdrawing her toes.  She moved the left spontaneously with\nminimal withdrawal to pain.  Her bran flap was flat and soft.\nShe continued with her vent drain in place.  She was set up\nfor trach and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube which\nwas done.\n\nThe patient received trach and percutaneous endoscopic\ngastrostomy tube on [**2195-12-16**].  The patient tolerated\nthe procedure well.  She continued to be neurologically\nunchanged.\n\nA head computed tomography on [**12-18**] showed no\nhydrocephalus.  Continued mass effect from swelling.  The\npatient continued to have vent drain in place.  The\ncraniectomy site was flat.  The patient did not follow\ncommands but was awake and attentive.  Briskly localizing in\nthe left upper extremity.  Minimal internal rotation of the\nright upper extremity on the 7th.\n\nA computed tomography on [**12-21**] showed an increase in\nventricle size with hydrocephalus.  The drain was put back\ndown to 8; had been at 12.  The patient was opening her eyes\nand attentive.  She was purposeful on the left upper\nextremity.  She was not following commands.  The patient\nremained monoplegic in the right upper extremity.\n\nThe patient went into congestive heart failure on the 14th;\ndiagnosed by x-ray.\n\nOn [**2195-12-29**] the patient went to the operating room\nfor bone flap replacement.  The patient tolerated the\nprocedure well.  She was turning her head toward the\nexaminer.  She continued to have a right facial grimace and\ninternal rotation of the right upper extremity to pain.  The\npatient's blood pressure was controlled to 130 to 150.  She\nhad a stable blood gas.  The vent drain remained at 10 cm\nabove the tragus.\n\nHer neurologic status remained stable, and she was taken back\nto the operating room on [**1-5**] for a right occipital\nventriculoperitoneal shunt placement.  The patient tolerated\nthat procedure well as well.  The patient was monitored in\nthe Intensive Care Unit for 24 hours and was then transferred\nto the regular floor on [**1-6**].  She remained\nneurologically the same.  She was awake and attentive.  She\nwas moving the left side to command.  She was wiggling her\ntoes to command with a right upper extremity plegia.  The\npatient was made do not resuscitate/do not intubate by the\nfamily in case of any untold events but continued to receive\nfull care.  She was awake and attentive.  She was squeezing\nthe left hand and wiggling her toes.\n\nDISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  She was transferred to the regular\nfloor.  She was seen by Physical Therapy and Occupational\nTherapy.  She was found to require acute rehabilitation.  Her\nincisions were clean, dry, and intact.  Her staples were\nremoved from her shunt on [**2196-1-15**].  Her craniectomy\nincision was clean, dry, and intact.  Her staples had been\nremoved.  She was to follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 1132**] in one\nmonth for a repeat head computed tomography.\n\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  (Her medications at the time of\ndischarge included)\n 1.

given 1mg Versed in O.R. holding area.\nPt's resp status also worsened (had been satting high 90s on\n3-4L NC on [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] floor down to 88% on NC after versed). AVR was\npostponed and pt brought to CRSU (admit CCU) where pt cont to\nhave labored breathing, ABG reavealed 7.14/113/190 and pt was\nintubated. Pt also had new Afib/flutter seen on tele and pt\nstarted on heparin gtt (lower target due to decreased plts).\n\nPt had MRI of head after M.S. changes which revealed: 2 punctate\nleft cerebral foci suggesting minute subacute embolic infarcts.\nPt was started on Keppra, insulin sliding scale, and low goal\nheparin gtt. Pt surgery delayed due to CVA. Pt CCU course c/b\nthe fact that after he was exubated pt would remain stable and\nfor a few minutes to hours and then suddenly go into respiratory\nacidosis.  Pt was put on bipap and his ABG numbers would\nnormalize and Bipap would be removed, pt would be fine for a few\nhours and again would retain CO2 and then bipap would be started\nagain.  Eventually weaned off all supplemental oxygen, though\nwith occassional need for 2L NC; goal sat 92%.\n\nA/P: 81yo man with failed porcine AV placed 18y PTA, sent for\nAVR that was aborted [**3-3**] hypercarbic resp failure after Versed,\nMRI with 2 minute subacute embolic infarcts, chest CT with\ndilated ascending aorta. Now with hematuria in setting of\nanticoagulation for PAF and embolic CVAs, being discharged to\nrehab facility in preparation for cardiothoracic surgery to fix\nhis AV and dilated Aorta.\n\n1. Cardio\n\nA. Coronaries: clean per [**9-18**] cath, cont ASA\n\nB. Pump: was initially on IV drips to control blood pressure and\ndecrease afterload including Natrecor and Nitroprusside,\neventually converted to PO meds, including metoprolol,\ncaptopril, nifedipine, lasix 40mg qd. Ultimately needs AVR [**Doctor First Name **]\nafter rehab, Rehab should make appt for pt with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 109669**]\nprior to his discharge from that facility.\n\nC. Rhythm: PAF in NSR currently; was maintained on telemetry\nthroughout his hospital stay; pt noted to have two small embolic\nstrokes during this admission; therefore he was maintained on\nanticoagulation thereafter to prevent further neuro insults;\ngiven his h/o GI bleeding he was kept with PTT goal 45-65 rather\nthan higher; metoprolol was used for rate control with good\neffect, coumadin was started prior to his discharge at 6mg qhs\nfor h/o embolic CVA with PAF; will watch for GI bleed in this pt\nwith h/o such. Goal INR 2.5. Will be discharged with heparin\nsliding scale for bridging therapy.\n\n2. Pulm: pt developed hypercarbic resp failure as noted in\npre-op suite for his repeat AVR; was very difficult to wean,\nrequiring bipap after extubated to decrease his CO2 retention.\nPFTs performed with both low FEV1 and low FVC, ratio FEV1/FVC\nnormal, thought by Pulm to be c/w restrictive disease from his\nCHF rather than COPD; high res CT scan performed which r/o\ninterstitial disease, showed only pleural effusions bilaterally\nc/w CHF.  On d/c, Lasix 40 mg PO qd for CHF, still with\neffusions though likely will need AVR to eradicate these\neffusions.\n\n3. Renal:  BUN/Cr slightly above 20:1 with continued lasix\ndiuresis, watched for evid of prerenal state\n\n4. ID: no active issues\n\n5. GI: had UGIB early during his hospital stay; EGD showed Grade\nII esophogitis, minor NGT trauma to stomach, nl duodenum,\ncontinued Protonix [**Hospital1 **]\n\n6. GU: pt developed hematuria with Foley and on heparin; Foley\nwas d/c'd, but pt then passed large clot and worse hematuria;\n3-lumen Foley placed, CBI started; hct stable through; held\nheparin for one night and then restarted; GU consult rec: hold\nCBI unless pt's UO drops; pt to be sent to [**Hospital1 **] with Foley\nin place. Urine on [**2149-10-9**] cleared, would keep Foley in place for\nanother week in case UO drops or patient becomes obstructed and\nneeds to have CBI again.\n\nDistant h/o prostate CA treated with seed brachytherapy.\n\n7. Heme: had episode of thrombocytopenia, no clear etiology\nfound, recovered on its own; had Hct drop as well, HIT Ab-;\nwould transfuse if hct \u003c 30 in this man with known CAD.\n\n8. Endo: maintained in RISS though borderline high sugars\n\n9. Neuro: s/p 2 small CVAs, cont heparin/coumadin as possibly\nfrom PAF source; started on Keppra per Neuro recs, cont Aricept\nas per his outpatient regimen\n\n10. Psych: cont Zyprexa\n\n11. PPx: cont bowel regimen, Protonix, heparin SS, coumadin\n\n12. Communication: no active issues\n\n13. Code: full\n\n14. Dispo: pt will benefit from short term rehab prior to his\nAVR; to go to [**Hospital3 **] prior to AVR\n\nMedications on Admission:\nTegretol 200 mg TID, Aricept 5 mg TID, Terazosin 10 mg daily,\nQuinine (for leg cramps)\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.

Below is her\nconsultationnote:\n\nIn summary, this is an 88 year old female with a history of\nproximal muscle weakness that started several months ago, but it\nis unclear the exact time of onset.  She clearly reports being\nunable to comb her hair due to shoulder weakness prior to the\nonset of her current complex hospitalization.\n\nSpecifically, the patient is fully alert and oriented with\nnormalcognition.  She currently has neck flexors and\nextensors,thatalthough slightly weak, may be appropriate for\nage.  Her shoulder girdles demonstrate marked wasting with 2/5\nstrength at thedeltoids, supraspinatus and infraspinatus.  The\npatient has 4+/5strength in the biceps, with only partial\nactivation (suggestinglikely C5 weakness with C6 relatively\nspared).  Distal strengthin the upper ext slightly reduced at\n4+/5.  Hip flexors [**4-17**] onthe left, [**3-17**] on the right. Distal\nstrength better at 4+/5 butslightly weaker on the right than\nleft.  Sensory exam revealsdistal decrease to vibration and\nproprioception with somevariable sensory changes in the upper\nextremities.  Reflexespresent (2's) everywhere except ankles\n(absent).  Toes upgoingbilaterally.\n\nAssessment:\n\nThis is an 88 year old female with multifactorial\nweakness that is more proximal than distal.  The patient clearly\nhas evidence for myelopathy with upgoing toes and substantial\nC-spine disease present in [**6-18**] by MRI scan (but suboptimal\nimages).  This is likely making a large contribution to her\nstrength.  She also has an axonal polyneuropathy and a\ngeneralized myopathy.  Most of her laboratory studies have been\nnormal, with no evidence for elevated CK.  The patient does have\na mildly elevated CRP and ESR, but not unexpectedly considering\nher hospital course.\n\nI would recommend vigorous physical therapy to prevent\ncontractures, and improve strength from deconditioning.  She\nshould have another MRI of her C-spine (the last one had too\nmuch motion artifact to actually determine the contribution it\nmay have on her presentation).  She is currently on a Statin,\nyou may want to consider an alternative [**Doctor Last Name 932**].  Further\nevaluation of her myopathy could require a muscle biopsy, would\nrecommend she follow up with the neuromuscular department as an\noutpatient to consider this possibility.\n\n\nDischarge Disposition:\nExtended Care\n\nFacility:\n[**Hospital3 163**] - [**Location (un) 164**]\n\n                             [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 168**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 730**] MD [**MD Number(2) 731**]\n\nCompleted by:[**2137-9-25**]"}

She was called out of the\nUnit to the floor on the Bloomgard service.\n\nAt the time of her discharge, the patient's history has\nincluded pulmonary issues with her being on a tracheostomy\nmask at 40% but off all antibiotics and on albuterol and\nAtrovent inhalers as needed.\n\nFrom a cardiovascular standpoint, she was on Lopressor,\nNorvasc for hypertension, amiodarone for paroxysmal atrial\nfibrillation.\n\nFrom an infectious disease standpoint, she had had many\ninfection over the hospital course but, currently on no\nantibiotics.\n\nFrom a gastrointestinal standpoint, the patient had\nreportedly had some recent abdominal pain and was receiving\nmorphine as needed for this, also Protonix and a bowel\nregimen.\n\nFrom a neurologic standpoint, the patient was unresponsive.\n\nFrom a vascular standpoint, the patient had known right groin\npseudoaneurysm which was simply being followed.\n\nThe patient was called out to the floor and continued to be\nstable.  On [**2105-3-6**], an electroencephalogram and\nmagnetic resonance imaging scan were done to determine the\nsource of her mental status changes.  The\nelectroencephalogram was consistent with encephalopathy, no\nfocal activity indicating seizures.  The magnetic resonance\nimaging scan could not be performed as the patient could not\nsit still and comply with the exam.\n\nAdditionally, the patient had occasional episodes of low\nblood pressure, which resolved without intermittent\ntreatment.  On one of these occasions, she was given a gentle\nbolus, however, her blood pressure seemed to respond the same\nway it did when she was not given boluses.\n\nOn [**2105-3-7**], the patient's white blood cell count rose\nto 4.7, although she afebrile.  A urinalysis was done which\nultimately grew out Klebsiella culture and she was started on\nciprofloxacin 500 mg twice a day for this.\n\nFrom [**3-8**], the patient continued on\nciprofloxacin and had no new issues.  She never spiked a\ntemperature.  Her blood pressure remained stable.  The only\nchanges to her medications were that her Norvasc was\ndiscontinued since it was deemed that she had these\noccasional low blood pressure episodes and she likely did not\nneed this, as she could tolerate slightly higher blood\npressures.\n\nAs of the time of this dictation, the plan was to send the\npatient to a nursing home.  This has been a major issue while\nin house.  Her family is insisting that she go to [**Hospital3 4287**], however, they will not accept her as she\ncannot currently participate in a rehabilitation program.\nThe attending, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **], is currently working with\nthe family and the case manager is having her screened for\nother facilities.  At the time of this dictation, the plan is\nfor the patient to be discharged as soon as a facility can be\nfound that the family is agreeable to.

Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.\nRegional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular\nsystolic function is low normal. Quantitative (biplane) LVEF = 52 %.\n[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given\nthe severity of mitral regurgitation.]Right ventricular chamber size and free\nwall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally\nnormal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic\nregurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. No mass or\nvegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral\nregurgitation is seen. Due to the eccentric nature of the regurgitant jet, its\nseverity may be significantly underestimated (Coanda effect). There is mild\npulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.\n\nIMPRESSION: Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation with grossly normal\nmorphology. Low normal left ventricular systolic function.\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2198-5-2**], the severity of\nmitral regurgitation has increased and left ventricular systolic function is\nless vigorous. Ascites is also now seen.\nIf clinically indicated, a TEE would be better able to assess mitral valve\nmorphology for a possible vegetation. A cardiac MRI would be better able to\nquantify left ventricular volumes and ejection fraction.\n\nCLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:\nBased on [**2192**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the echo findings\nindicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical decisions regarding the need\nfor prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.\n\n\n"}
